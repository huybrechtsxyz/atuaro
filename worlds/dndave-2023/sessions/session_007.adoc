== Plot Evolution


== Plot Summary
After lunch the kids take a short nap in their room. Waking up each player gets a boon depending on how they played. Antonio checked the well: no treasure there. The deal with the pixies and go to the carnival. Then try to get to the treasure map at location 7.  At the moment they only saw the animals, the guards tent, and the entrance. Tyrion (Dave) failed to distract the guard for others to go inside of the tent. Tyrion tries to distract the guard while Antonio tries to look in. Both failed at their attempt. They continue their visit to the carnival. Owlbears and displacer beats. They are put in cages. They found a treasure map and met with a magician with quick hands. Mario was eating a lot of cake and told silly jokes on stage with Antonio. What is the difference between a snowman and snowwoman? Snowballs. 

By Angela. I was called back from my mission to return to Kainga. I do not know why, but the moment I stept inside the Stonehill In I knew. There was Room 4. She had the shown them the light of Ohm. There was no other way. They were searching for a treasure. I had to help them. Antonio got into trouble for something and we had to leave the town. We got lost in the woods. During our night we found a spying goblin. A good moment to reflect.

They notice a lot of blood in the goblins hair, that could not only be his.
The goblin had made drawings of the heroes:
- Tyrion: Power
- Mario: Power
- Antonio: Short
- Angela: Question
- Cornus: Death skull

== Start of session


== Session Notes
The adventurers do not loot the rest of the dungeon and only loot the alter and the hobgoblin leader Cracus.
Antonio takes
- the golden ring of Cracus with the symbol of Whirotepua (disturbs long rest on failure of DC10, valued at 20GP)
- the silver dagger from the altar (valued at 100GP)

Jack, the bodyguard of Gundren, is burried by Cornus and Angela in the first room.

They take a short rest before continuing. No random encounter.

Angela uses sacred flame to sterilize the ritual hall. Ohm gives her a pat on the back by sending a signal in the back of her mind.

Antonio shows the map to Gundren who when they reach the road. He recognizes now where they are and leads them to the entrance of the delian tomb. They meet the goblin patrol and dispatch (kill) them.

== Post Session
* They still have to loot the dungeon.

=== Pending Plot Points

* Treasury map is a QR code ?

== Rules Discussions

*Half Cover*
A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

*Three-Quarters Cover*
A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.

*Total Cover*
A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.
