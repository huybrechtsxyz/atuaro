== Plot Summary
After lunch the kids take a short nap in their room. Waking up each player gets a boon depending on how they played. Antonio checked the well: no treasure there. The deal with the pixies and go to the carnival. Then try to get to the treasure map at location 7.  At the moment they only saw the animals, the guards tent, and the entrance. Tyrion (Dave) failed to distract the guard for others to go inside of the tent. Tyrion tries to distract the guard while Antonio tries to look in. Both failed at their attempt. They continue their visit to the carnival. Owlbears and displacer beats. They are put in cages. They found a treasure map and met with a magician with quick hands. Mario was eating a lot of cake and told silly jokes on stage with Antonio. What is the difference between a snowman and snowwoman? Snowballs. 

By Angela. I was called back from my mission to return to Kainga. I do not know why, but the moment I stept inside the Stonehill In I knew. There was Room 4. She had the shown them the light of Ohm. There was no other way. They were searching for a treasure. I had to help them. Antonio got into trouble for something and we had to leave the town. We got lost in the woods. During our night we found a spying goblin. A good moment to reflect.

They notice a lot of blood in the goblins hair, that could not only be his.
The goblin had made drawings of the heroes:
- Tyrion: Power
- Mario: Power
- Antonio: Short
- Angela: Question
- Cornus: Death skull

After their escape from the Death Pith of Whirotepua, Gundren helps them on their way to the Delian Tomb. They killed the partol and are nearing the entrance of the Delian tomb. They rush the entrance guards and can kill them before they can get help. The adventurers go inside the tomb and attack the six goblins in the offering room, hearing the screams of Bess continue to the hall of the Oathkeeper. They kill the shaman before he can really do anything useful and save the girl. They take a long rest in the offering room. Before leaving the tomb, cornus buried the Goblins, and noticed the color of their skull.

They bring back Bess to the village and reunite her with her parents. They use Bess to get a good price with her father (Pasha).Failing to appease them with religion or charm. However they are willing to to give them a discount. Angela uses her religious knowledge in a conversation to Hibiscus. He was caught asking about Cornus, but was able to block any further questioning.

Agreeing to the proposal of Gundren to be his guardsmen on his route to Loukotokia, the depart the next day. After the snake caught them off guard, the horses rear up and Gundren and Antonio fall of the cart. The heroes dispatch of their problems with ease. Tyrion finding and throwing the snake in the bushes, cornus tending to the horses and Angela after Gundren.

They make short work of the dogs. At the nights rest Antonio threathens Gundren and pushes horse manure in his face. Gundren wants to storm of but somehow manages to calm him down enough for him not to do so. They find the the body and examine it. They know some kind of animal sucked the blood out of the lifeless body, but choose not to investigate further. They reach the Silverpine Watch with Gundren still angry and in a bad mood; although others try to make up for it.

The team of 'heroes' reach the Silverpine Watch. They try to get on top of the castle. Only Cornus did not fail to scale the lower tower - according to them the best and only way to get into the east tower and thus the entire Silverpine Watch. After failing, the team, with the help of Gundren, they figure out there is a door. They enter the door, try to parley with the ghost of Sir Arpaad, only scaring Tyrion. They go through the door to the gathering hall, selecting to take the coats and boots, but missing the fact that there was one set missing. Descending the stairs to meet and defeat the zombies.

After killing the zombies, they search all the trunks and find what is within, looting the Marshal Brask’s room in the process. Almost finding their better in the stirges, but finding the necklace in their nest. Antonio likes the amulet and wears it. The continue searching the rooms (7, 8, 9, 7, 20, 23, 24). When they find the ghost of sir Arpaad they try avoid fighting it. Although Antonio was able to resist the golden weapon next to sir Arpaad's body, Angela has problems resisting her will to cast down the foul aparition. As Ohm clearly not approves.

They fight sir Arpaad and manage to go through the towers and zombies. After they manage to open the portcullis, Gundren drives of leaven them the money. They sleep and start roaming what is left of the watch. Antonio is still hanging in there but is starting to feel its effects. (See below: Antonio and the cursed ring). They kill the revenant blacksmith and destroy the dagger.

They do kind of piece together what happened and go on to Loukotokia.

  * Flashback of Angela +
  finding an imposter and saving the Messia's Foot and the religious festival. Success.

  * Flashback of Mario +

  * Flashback of Cornus +
  Stopping a dog fighting ring The culprit is in jail! Success.

  * Flashback of Tyrion. +
  Killing the fighters is ok, but non-fighters not. Stopped an illegal fight ring. Success.

  * Flashback of Antonio. +
  Antonio is the laughing stock in the thieves guild for steeling the teddybear of the young Mr. Neurdragon junior. At least that is what he is accused of by someone who is spreading rumors. These actions have reached Magnifico's ears, and his once-proud mentor is deeply disappointed. He believes in the innocence of Antonio and proposes to steal something really valuable from Mr Neurdragon. He is supposed to have a codex of some sort (~book). It is being whispered that all his riches, power, and knowledge are bound to it. Angela has no real appetite in helping out as it is believed the Neurdragons are good people. But agrees to take the party as choirboys (?) during a coming-of-age ceremony. The party uses the communion of the young son of Mr. Neurdragon as a guise to infiltrate the Neurdragon estate for reconnaissance purposes. While Angela and her father Pacal perform the rites, multiple members of the team try to talk to the young boy about the teddybear. It seems that the boy 'lost' his teddybear and the locket that was attached to it. Although silver, for Perseus it is the emotional attachment that matters. Its disappearance has left a void in the heart of its owner, who longs to be reunited with the precious keepsake. Then trying to scout the premises, until one member is caught in the proverbial cooky jar. Tyrion while sneaking upstairs finds the Crystal Room. A guard caught Tyrion, and locked him in the premises and waiting with  further investigations until the ceremony was concluded. He first tried to escape through the window, breaking it down, and making noise in the process. This caught the attention of one of the guards. Tyrion was able to knock the guard unconscious and escape by running through the house. The commotion is not unnoticed during the ceremony, but Pacal and Neurdragon keep their cool and continue the ceremony. Both will have something on their mind about these events. Antonio and the rest of the party regroup. Have a conversation with Magnifico. There they learn that he is mostly in it for himself. They recon the place for a week. The Pinkertons, wearing all black, with black carriages, were present, but have left by now. The Patrician visited the Neurdragon estate.
  
  Antonio, Cornus, and Tyrion successfully heist the Neurdragon estate in the dead of night, stealing the Codex. Mario stands guard during the operation.
  
  * Antonio fails a Wisdom save and is affected by Whispers of the Dread Realm.
  * Angela discovers the situation and, with the help of Cornus, performs a literal exorcism over the ring that afflicted Antonio. Angela states, "Het is magnifico, niet misterio," signifying her understanding of the situation.
  * Despite the party’s efforts, the Patrician acquires the Codex anyway. (He lets it steal from the library, reasons and method unknown).
  * Antonio holds the golden ring of Cracus, bearing the symbol of Whirotepua. The cursed ring: disturbs a long rest if a WIS DC10 is failed. Is valued at 20GP but has a steep cost—Antonio gains no benefits from long rests except for recovering half his hit dice. Fortunately, one of the clerics removes the cursed ring.

They visit with Gundren Rockseeker, apologize for what happened and smooth out the wrinkles, and heads to Kainga leading the cart with goods. They see dead horses and are ambushed by goblins but kill all the enemies, clearing the way forward.

After the fight with the goblins, we notice they are drenched in blood that isn’t their own. We bury the horses. The goblin loot = junk. Gundren's scent leads us along a narrow path through the forest (Druids an wild form ...). Antonio scouts ahead while the rest buries the horses. Antonio decides not to venture too far and returns to guide the group.

Cornus discovers a large snare -> Antonio disarms it, and no one questions the presence of such a large trap (perhaps they're trying to catch large animals due to hunger?). When we reach a cave, we walk into another ambush, but Cornus swiftly deals with the goblins in his bear form. Just inside the cave, we find three chained-up wolves. They try to break free and attack us. We kill the first two, and Mario intimidates the third, thinking about taming it. Tyrion disagrees…

As we venture deeper into the cave, we encounter more goblins. One of them pulls a lever, opening some sluices, and Angela is washed out of the cave by the flood. We fight our way further into the cave and face the goblin chief, a hobgoblin. We quickly take him down as well. After one final push, we find Sildar, who is being held hostage by a surviving goblin. The goblin threatens to kill him if we take a step closer. Tyrion, not one for diplomacy, attacks, causing the goblin to slit Sildar’s throat. We take down the goblin, and thankfully, we manage to stabilize Sildar.

Arriving at Kainga, we have learned that Gundren is being held by the Black Spider, and visit some of the local merchants. The visit the Blue Lionshield, a trading guild, also a bit strange. (Finder's fee: split fairly). Sildar is asking around about Gundren’s whereabouts, but is really waiting for an acquaintance of his. They go to the Mayor about the red brands and notice that he is worried about the orcs, and really cowardly towards the red brands. They start spying on them.
 
*"They find the map to Wave Echo Cave in the goblin hideout !"*

The go and follow a lead that leads them to the secret entrance of the Red Brands hideout. The beast in the gorge holds these secrets:

* Tyrion lived with the blacksmith. The blacksmith died in a fire while Tyrion was with a lady.
* Mario once beat someone nearly to death. He enjoyed it.
* Angela: Her mother died during childbirth, or so her father claimed. Angela believes there is more to the story and doesn’t fully trust her father's explanation.
* Cornus: He grew up in the orphanage and had revealed that Witchling knew who his father was. She betrayed him that way. Cornus questions why she never told him before and why his father never acknowledged him. This has fueled his deep hatred for his father.

Lord Gilad Shams' Letter:

    "My spies in Loukotokia inform me that strangers are expected to arrive in Kainga. They could be working for the dwarves. Capture them if possible, kill them if necessary, but do not allow them to interfere with our plans. Ensure that any dwarven maps they have are sent to me immediately. I'm counting on you, Gilad. Do not disappoint me."

Well he did disappoint. He failed in protecting his hideout while the adventurers rampaged through his base. In the end he tried to escape, but was caught. When the full base was searched, our brave heroes noticed that they kidnapped an innocent woman and their children, and that they were killed during the raid. They promised Gilad Sham's a fair trial... After some discussion, that is what he will receive.

*The can become level 3*

  -  3 on the dice: easy.
  -  7 on the dice: simple.
  - 11 on the dice: standard.
  - 15 on the dice: hard.
  - 19 on the dice: impossible.

*Pacal Zaramus' Disposition* towards the party (Excellent, Good, Okay, Dislike, Bad)? +
    Excellent. (Start of the trip) +
    *Good.* (Downtime of Angela)

*Gundren's Disposition* towards the party (Excellent, Good, Okay, Dislike, Bad)? +
    Excellent. (Start of the trip) +
    Good. (They haggle about the price with bess in mind) +
    *Okay.* (Behaviour of Antonio) +
    Bad.  (Behaviour of Antonio) +

  -> Gundren disposition had an effect where no one really thrusted the party.
     By succeeding on the results, it is now back Okay.
     Important is the resolution of the last story.

=== Previous session 

Goblin leeft niet meer.
Short rest.

 Roll (2d6)	Random Event
2	Reinforcements Arrive: A small patrol of 2 hobgoblins and 1 wolf returns to the castle. They notice the players if they are not hidden.
3	Falling Rubble: Part of the ceiling in the room the players are in collapses due to the castle's decrepit state. Each player makes a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage.
4	Captured Prisoner: The party stumbles upon a bound and gagged prisoner, a commoner or a low-ranking soldier. They could provide information or beg for rescue.
5	Goblin Squabble: Two goblins argue loudly in the next room, likely about food or loot. If unnoticed, the players can easily overhear them and possibly gain tactical advantage.
6	Mysterious Footsteps: The sound of hurried, light footsteps echoes through the hallways. There is no visible source, but the sound heightens tension. It could be a goblin scout or something supernatural.
7	Looted Supplies: The players find a stash of food, gear, and miscellaneous items. Most of it is worthless, but a small pouch contains 10 gp and a healing potion. It looks recently looted from a caravan.
8	Unattended Wolf: The party encounters a lone wolf chained to a wall or stake. It's hungry and aggressive, but can be calmed or tamed with a successful DC 14 Animal Handling check. Otherwise, it attacks.
9	Trap Triggered: The players accidentally trip a simple snare trap. Each player makes a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or is restrained by a rope that lifts them off the ground. They need to cut the rope or make a DC 13 Strength check to escape.
10	Hidden Shrine: The players discover a long-abandoned shrine to Maglubiyet (the goblin god of war) in a side chamber. The air feels heavy with ancient, dark magic. Players inspecting it closely might find a magical item or experience a strange vision.
11	Creepy Whispering: The castle’s eerie silence is broken by faint whispers in an unknown language. A successful DC 15 Arcana check reveals that it's a remnant of ancient magic, but it may also just be wind or an old goblin trick.
12	Goblins Feasting: The players come across 4 goblins noisily feasting on some questionable meat. They are distracted, giving the players advantage on attack rolls or Stealth checks to approach unnoticed.

=== Current session 31

They kill king groll, find 90 gold and 30 on the one drow

== Rules Discussions

*Half Cover*
A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

*Three-Quarters Cover*
A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.

*Total Cover*
A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle. 

*Who knows an item is magic?*
Whatever a magic item’s appearance, handling the item is enough to give a character a sense that something is extraordinary about it. Discovering a magic item’s properties isn’t automatic, however. It will feel like a small buzz of static electricity.

*Do you have to identify a magic item to be able to use it?*
The identify spell is the fastest way to reveal an item’s properties. Alternatively, a character can focus on one magic item during a short rest, while being in physical contact with the item. At the end of the rest, the character learns the item’s properties, as well as how to use them. Potions are an exception; a little taste is enough to tell the taster what the potion does.

* Yes, for items you need to activate the effects of. You can't activate its effects unless you know how to use the item.
  - E.g. Most wands, ring of evasion, bag of tricks, stone of controlling earth elementals.
  - Spend a short rest focusing on the item.
  - Cast identify on the item. This takes 1 minute.
  - Get instruction from someone who already knows how to use it.
* No, for items that passively grant benefits
  - You gain the effects from simply using the item as normal (depending on attunement, see below).
  - E.g. Weapons, shields, armor, cloak of elvenkind, gauntlets of ogre power, ring of free action.
* For items with both passive and active effects
  - If an item has passive abilities and has abilities that require actions then you only gain the passive ones (depending on attunement, see below).
  - E.g. If you are using a staff of striking without identifying it, then you will have the +3 attack and damage bonuses, but you won't be able to expend charges.
* Using a non-attuned item
  - For an item that requires attunement, you only gain the non-magical benefits while not attuned. You can use a magical sword, but it will not give any attack or damage bonus, and will not count as magical for the purposes of bypassing resistance. You can use a magical shield, but it will only give +2 AC. You can wear a robe of stars but you won't get a saving throw bonus or be able to cast magic missile.
* Using an attuned item without identifying it
  - This is not explicitly mentioned in the books. The SRD says that the short rest used for attunement cannot be the same rest that identified the item, but says nothing about the order of the two rests.
