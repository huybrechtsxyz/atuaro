# Atuaro: Fall of the Silverpine Watch

The gate at Silverpine Watch is closed. The road is blocked. The garrison is dead. And a party of inexperienced heroes, hired by a merchant to see her safely through Silverpine Forest, must enter the keep and raise the gates. To do so, the heroes will have to destroy the walking dead, evade the mad ghost of the Watch’s former commander, and solve the mystery of an ancient warlord’s curse.
