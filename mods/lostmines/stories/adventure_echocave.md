# Lost Mines of Kainga

## Echo Cave

Fifteen miles east of Kainga, in the deep vales of the Sword Mountains, lies Wave Echo Cave. The rich mine of the Phandelver's Pact was lost five hundred years ago during ore invasions that devastated this part of the North. In the centuries since, countless prospectors and adventurers have searched for the lost mine, but none succeeded until the Rockseeker brothers found the entrance a month ago.

Unfortunately, the Rockseekers did not realize they were being trailed by spies working for Nezznar, the Black Spider, and they inadvertently led the drow villain to their prize. Nezznar and his followers dealt with the two Rockseekers who were guarding their find, then arranged for Gundren's ambush. Learning of the adventurers' involvement with Gundren or their exploits in and around Kainga, the Black Spider has given orders for the characters to be dealt with.

Meanwhile, Nezznar has begun his exploration of Wave Echo Cave. The drow is searching for the Forge of Spells, where the human mages of old Kainga enchanted dwarven weapons and gnome gadgets. However, Nezznar's exploration has been hindered by the restless undead and dangerous monsters that lurk in Wave Echo Cave, forcing him to proceed with great caution. The adventurers now have the chance to aid Gundren, avenge his kin, and put a stop to the nefarious schemes of the Black Spider. And of course, the hoard of powerful magic rumored to be hidden in the mines is a rich prize.

## 1a. Cave Entrance

> The entrance tunnel leads into a large-cavern supported by a natural pillar of rock and containing three stalagmites. In the western part of the cave, behind the column ofrock, are three bedrolls and a heap of ordinary supplies-sacks of flour, bags of salt, casks of salted meat, lanterns, flasks of lamp oil, pickaxes, shovels, and other gear. Amid the supplies, you see the body of a dwarf miner, dead for at least a week.

Campsite of the Rockseekers. The dead dwarf is Tharden, Gundren's brother.

## 1b. Open Pit

> The northeastern section of the cavern has collapsed, forming a ten-foot-wide, twenty-foot-deep pit. A sturdy hemp rope is tied off around a nearby stalagmite and dangles down the side of the pit, at the bottom of which is a rough-hewn tunnel heading northwest and east.

Climbing up or down the wall of the pit of 20 feet:

- Without a rope requires
  - DC 15 Strength (Athletics) check.
  - Fail by 5? 1d6 bludgeoning damage per 10 ft. Prone.

The tunnel at the bottom of the pit leads northwest toward area 2 and east toward area 3.

## 2. Mine Tunnels

> This area consists of numerous intersecting passages.
The ceilings here are only six feet high, and several of the
passages end in partially excavated rock faces.

Patiently lurking in a dead-end passage is an ochre jelly.

When the party enters this section of the mine, the jelly begins to stalk the group waiting for an opportunity to attack a lone target.

## 3. Old Entrance

> Many tunnels intersect at this natural, thirty-foot-high cavern. The walls are carved with simple reliefs showing dwarf and gnome miners hard at work. Below them, nearly two dozen skeletons in rusted scraps of armor are scattered across the cavern floor. Some are dwarf skeletons, while others are orc remains. Half a dozen large brass lanterns stand in niches or on ledges around the cavern, but none are lit.

- Clinging to the ceiling are **ten ravenous stirges.**
  - Any character who isn't watching the ceiling is surprised

The tunnel that runs south was the original entrance. A pitched battle was fought here when the ores stormed the mines. The dead still lie where they fell.

## 4. Old Guardroom

> Splintered stone benches and heaps of rubble from a partially collapsed ceiling fill this room. Amid ruined stone bunks and toppled weapon racks are the bones of several dwarves and orcs.

- In the rubble are NINE knit together skeletons that form.
  - They fight until destroyed.

## 5. Assayers' Office

> This chamber was once an office or storeroom of some kind. A large stone counter bisects the room, set with three dusty balance scales made of iron. Cubbyholes carved into the north wall are stuffed with dusty paper scraps. Several long-dead corpses-gnomes and ores by their look-are sprawled across the floor.

- The centuries-old paper in the cubbyholes disintegrates
if touched.
- Dwarvish readers see faint markings recording a ledger

The mine's assayers worked here, weighing and assessing
ore samples and paying the minors for their labor.

**Treasure** Behind the counter sits a locked iron strongbox
-> thieves' tools DC 20 Dexterity to open.
->  contains 600 cp, 180 sp, and 60 gp.

## 6. South Barracks

> Old stone bunks in orderly rows line the walls of this chamber, and a corroded iron brazier full of old coals stands near the middle of the room. The bones of a half dozen dwarves and orcs lie strewn about, clad in scraps of armor. Three gray, hunched figures squat among the remains, pawing at the scraps and gnawing on the bones.

- Three ghouls
  - The ghouls, eager for a fresh meal, attack immediately.

## 7. Ruined Storeroom

> The eastern wall of this chamber has collapsed into a mass of
rubble. To the north, a door stands ajar, leading to a good-
sized storeroom. Dusty kegs are tucked neatly against the
walls, all of them cracked and split open from age.

- It's not comfortable, but the storeroom is a secure
resting place. No monsters come this way. Moreover, the
storeroom door is in good shape and can easily be blocked
or barred from the inside.
- The contents of the kegs have long evaporated.

## 8. Fungi Cavern

> Dense carpets of weird fungi cover large sections of the floor in this cavern. The growth includes puffballs a foot across, weird shelf fungus growing on stalagmites, and large stalks and caps a good five feet tall. Some of the puffballs glow with an eerie green phosphorescence.

- **Poison Gas.** Creature crosses the cavern
  - Fungi release poisonous gas into the air.
  - Each creature in the cavern DC 11 Constitution saving
throw or take 3d6 poison damage and be poisoned for 10

- **Green-glowing fungi** allow creatures to see the entire cavern without the aid of darkvision or a light source.

## 9. Great Cavern

> Steep escarpments divide this large cavern into three sections-high ledges at either end, and a lower section in the middle. Carved stone stairs climb up to the ledges. Two large tables stand in the middle section, along with a pair of old braziers. A smaller table stands on the eastern ledge. The skeletal remains of dozens of dead warriors-dwarves, gnomes, orcs, and ogres-attest to the fierceness of the fighting that took place here long ago.

- Ghouls lurk in the shadows on the western ledge.
  - They notice any light or noise. quickly bound down to attack.
  - The undead are hungry and fight until destroyed.

- The escarpments are 10 feet high - DC 12 Strength (Athletics).
  - 1d6 bludgeoning damage and lands prone.

## 10. Dark Pool

> A still pool fills much of this cavern. The water is dark,revealing little of what might lie within. The shore of the pool consists of a thin layer of broken shells from strange, pale mussels, and a fishy odor hangs in the air.
>
> A passage leads south from this area, and a set of steps climbs up to the east. A sluggish stream flows out of the cave to the northeast.

- The pool is 20 feet deep in the middle.
- Treasure is concealed in this water-filled cave.
- The stream to the NE is 3 feet deep, and the ceiling is 1 feet above the water.

**Treasure** Remains of a human wizard with two platinum rings (75 gp each).

A character who explores the pool finds an old skeleton lying on the bottom, 10 feet from the shore and under 10 feet of water. These are the remains of a human wizard from old Kainga who died defending the mines against the ore attackers. Several ore arrows are still lodged in the skeleton's ribcage.

## 11. North Barracks

> Old stone bunks line the walls of this barracks, which is lit and Iheated by a glowing iron brazier in the middle of the room.

If the party enters from the west, add:

> Across the room is another door, this one blocked by a
barricade made from the remains of a wooden table.

- **Five bugbears** reside in this chamber.

- **Barricaded door** The eastern door is barricaded from inside the room:
  - Requires a DC 20 Strength check to force open.
  - Listens at either door and on a DC 10 Wisdom (Perception) check hears gruff voices speaking Goblin and talking about how hungry they are.

Five bugbears reside in this chamber. They are loyal minions of Nezznar. This room marks the front line in the Black Spider's assault on Wave Echo Cave, and the bugbears are here to prevent ghouls, zombies, or other undead from troubling their master in his lair (area 19).

Like area 6, this was formerly a barracks for miners. Nezznar's bugbears removed the corpses they found here and built the barricade.

**Treasure** The largest bugbear carries a pouch containing 15 cp, 13 gp, and a potion of vitality.

## 12. Smelter Cavern

> A blast furnace and a mechanical bellows powered by a waterwheel dominate this large chamber. The furnace is cold and dark, but heaps of coal are piled nearby, along with carts full of unrefined ore. The waterwheel sits in a ten-foot-wide channel cut into the floor of the room, but the channel is dry. Passages exit to the west, south, and east. The empty channel exits to the north and east. More than a dozen withered corpses are scattered around the room. These slain dwarves and orcs are still wearing the remnants of their armor. Floating above them is a skull engulfed in green flame.

- Green flameskull
- Eight of the fallen dwarf warriors are zombies.

Like the fungi cavern at area 8, this chamber poses a serious obstacle that prevents Nezznar from reaching his objective-the Forge of Spells (area 15). The drow is still formulating a plan to get past the undead guardians in this area.

Eight of the fallen dwarf warriors are zombies. They rise and pursue any living creatures that enter the room, but they do not pursue creatures outside this area for more than 1 round. In addition, a far more intelligent undead guards this area: a ftameskull. This creature was a servant of the human wizards allied with the Phandelver dwarves and gnomes, and it continues to act on ancient instructions to prevent intruders from passing through.

This impressive chamber was the heart of the Wave Echo Cave mining operation. Here, the dwarves melted down their ore to refine ingots of silver, gold, and platinum. The dry channel is where the dwarves diverted the stream from area 18 to power the waterwheel here. That in turn operated the bellows that fed the furnace.

The channel's bottom is 5 feet below floor level, and no ability check is required to scramble in or out. Characters in the channel can follow it out of this room to the north or to the east, though the ceiling is only 5 feet high after the channel exits this room.
