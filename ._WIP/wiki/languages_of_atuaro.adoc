# Languages of Atuaro (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)

Custodi journals are actually recorded in Low Celestine. Mortals are incapable of speaking High Celestine. High Celestine is the language of the divine and it can be understood by any intelligent being who hears it. It can also be used to channel divine magical power and create miracles. Low Celestine is used by the church to record scripture and serves a similar purpose to that of Latin for the Catholic church throughout the middle ages and into the modern era. 

There are several interesting and unusual details regarding language in Atuaro. There are several human regional languages, such as Sund, Alqaad, and Zethinian and most humans speak at least one. Common is actually more correctly called Traders. Common and evolved from a pidgin language used during the age of the Helvetican Empire to facilitate trade between different regions.

Halflings do not have a true language of their own. Rather, they speak Half Cant, a slang language composed of borrowed words from other languages, incomprehensible idioms, and hand gestures.

Arcane magic formulas generally incorporate elven script with draconic runes and usually form the basis for evocation and transmutation magic. Elven script is often used in illusion and enchantment magic. These reflect the magical traditions that originated with those races.

Non-dragons speak a debased form of draconic called Low Draconic. Because they lack forked tongues and have such different jaw structures and facial muscles, humans just can't make the same sounds that dragons can. Are these details important? Not for this adventure.
