== Summary

Our heroes return after 10 years to Kainga and notice that things are changed. The orphanage burned down and there is no sight of Ms Witchling or the offspring. Recently, there has been an in influx of goblins in the region and some of the foul creatures have even begun attacking the farms in the outskirts of the village of Kainga.

== To Do List

. Create an introduction chapter that explains what is going on in this adventure.
. Create a treasury map puzzle
. What if they skip the patrol? Does it trigger an attack if the team rests in the tomb?
. Make the silverpine road a more encouter based system with rounds

== Welcome Back

Welcome back to Kainga, now save the blacksmith's daughter or figure out the treasury map.

=== On the road

> As you make your way through the winding path that leads to the village, you find yourself surrounded by tall trees on either side. The dense branches overhead form a canopy that blocks out much of the sunlight, casting shadows across the forest floor. The ground beneath your feet is soft and silent, covered in a layer of leaves and moss. As you move deeper through the woods, the air grows cooler, and the sounds of the outside world fade away. The only sounds you can hear are the rustling of leaves and the occasional chirping of birds. The path itself is wide enough to support wagons and horses, but it's twisting and winding, and it's easy to get lost if you stray too far from it. 

Each player (or group of players) walk through the forest and have an event. Roll 2d6.

*Old Lady* +
Rosie Beestinger is a halfling, which means she is short in stature, standing at about 3-4 feet tall. She has tan skin and dark hair that is usually styled in a pixie cut. Her hair is often adorned with various baubles and trinkets that reflect her fun-loving and adventurous personality. Rosie has bright green eyes that sparkle with mischief, and she often wears a sly smirk on her face.

=== Stonehill Inn
> As you approach the village, the trees start to thin out, and you can see patches of farmland and grazing animals in the distance. The path becomes wider and more defined. You emerge from the woods and see the village in front of you, nestled in a valley with the surrounding countryside in the background. You make your way to the village and the Inn.
> 
> 10 years have passed when you return to Kainga. In the center of the town stands a large roadhouse of field stone and rough-hew timbers. Dusk falls and several people come to the Stonehill Inn for food, warmth, and a place to rest. The common room is filled with locals nursing their mugs of ale, wine, or cider. All of them eyeing you with curiosity. One day is much the same as another in this outcrop of civilization. But, looking at you, something tells these people something will be different today. You seat yourself at one of the tables.

The proprietor is a short, friendly young human male named *Toblen Stonehill*. Toblen is a native of the town to the east. He came to Kainga to chop wood, but soon realized that he knew a lot more about running an inn than he did about wood. He has his wife and children.

The characters' other alternative for lodging is to camp outside the town, or to persuade a farmer such as Daran Edermath or Qelline Alderleaf to let them sleep in a hayloft.

*Let the characters meet each other after the 10 years absence.* +
Describe in-character what they did as profession. + 
How they look. +

> A man is approaching the table. He has a spring in his step and has short hair parted on one side styled in a somewhat messy styled fashion. He has gruff beard. He seems purposeful and confident in the way he walks. 
> Hi. I'm Mat. Can I get you anything to drink? to eat?
> Not many rat catchers coming through Kainga these days.

After taking orders he asks casual:
> Where are you from? Where are you going?

Give them a chance to interact with Matt. He is then off fixing whatever the PCs have ordered, and the characters have had a chance to get to know each other and the NPCs. Now something has to happen...

Either they have a treasury map you can use this hook.
Otherwise the goblins will kidnap the blacksmith's daughter.

=== The inciting incident
_If the adventurers have a treasury map follow The Treasury Map, otherwise follow the alternative The Backsmith's Daughter path._

==== A. The Treasury Map 
The players think they have found out about the treasury map during some drinks and deside to go about to find the treasure.

==== B. The Blacksmith's Daughter 
> A large man, wearing a black leather apron over linen shirt and woollen pants bursts in the door. He smells of sulfur and carries a heavy hammer.
> "They got Bess", he says, "they got my girl!"

Goblins have kidnapped the Blacksmith's daughter!

The characters know about Pasha Lebedev but lost contact with him during their years out of town. He is now the towns blacksmith. The villagers all know Pasha, he's well-loved hard working man, but none of them are equipped to face the challenge of hunting down goblins.

Pasha will recognize the band of rat catchers as quickly as anyone, and he won't hesitate to approach his earlier friends to ask for their help. If your players aren't motivated, simply by their sense of justice and duty, you can have Lars point out that their is a standing bounty for goblin ears by order of the mayor. Pasha married Rufina and have a daughter named Bess.

_Pasha_ 
> I do not know where they took her. As he walks the towns dirt road back to his smithy he pleads for your help. 

_DM_ 
> "What do you do?". 

Pasha doesn't know where the goblins took his daughter, but he's confident that a competent adventurer can find tracks in the area around his house. While Lars can offer this information to the players if they seem to be feeling stuck, you should give them the chance to propose searching the crime scene on their own. You can simply narrate the journey from the Stonehill Inn to the' Smithy, describing the dirt road and the trees that dot the path. 
 
You can even have Pasha nudge them and ask, "do you see any tracks?". Here is your first opportunity to ask the player searching for tracks to make a Ability Check.

* The tracks are plentiful, and easy to spot.
* DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check recognizes that at least two goblins dragged something north, into the forest. It was resisting.

=== The Woods

==== A. Treasury map
> As you make your way into the dense forest trying to keep the map synchronized with the path. The map depicts the forest, showing various landmarks and obstacles in the area. The darkness has become too great to navigate or see in the forest any further. You find a small clearing and set up camp.

==== B. Blacksmith's Daughter
> You travel deep into the woods, tracking the trail left by the goblins long in the night. The darkness has become too great to navigate or see in the forest any further. You find a small clearing and set up camp.

The woods are a large expanse of forest. The locals hunt here frequently, and it is free of goblins. If the goblins went this way, they must have a hideout somewhere. The journey to the other side of the forest is going to take a bit longer than what they can cover in a single day, the adventurers will be required to spend the night. This is a great opportunity to remind the players that the wilderness is a dangerous place, your goal here is to make the players take watch in middle of the forest and feel wary, wondering if something is going to attack them in the middle of the night!

*Skill Challenge [DC10]!* +
_Treasury Map_: How are they making sure to read the map right and follow the tracks through the woods?

_Blacksmith's Daughter_: How are they tracking the goblins through the forest?

* Only skills you have proficiency in
* You can only use a skill once
* 3 Successes for 3 failures

*Random Encounter [1D12]* +

* If the player rolls a 9 or 10 a boar comes to investigate the camp (non combat unless they attack it) 
* If the player rolls a 11 or 12 then a goblin is spying on them. If they see it, they can attack it as it is stuk in a tree. He will not spill the beans, but does mention how tasty humans are.

>In the center of this cavernous room, between a stone altar and a cracked statue of a demonic entity, you can see a decrepit man in gold threaded cloak, flanked by two watchful goblins. On the altar is a dissected cadaver that he gleefully stuffs with green glowing slime. 
>
>As he notices your presence, he looks up, points his finger at you and says "Can't wait to become Whirotepua's followers, do you? Come, let me reward your enthusiasm!"

== The Delian Tomb

image::{homedir}/assets/maps/gauntlet_tomb.png[align=center]

=== Area 1 - Goblin Patrol
>Just beyond the reach of the woods a clearing stretches out before low sprawling hills. In the distance the stonework of a tomb is just barely visible between the sparse trees and rolling hills. You briefly spot a small form moving about the hilltop ahead of you.

> DM: "Are you trying to avoid being seen?"

*Stealth?* +
Roll a Dexterity (Stealth) Ability Check against DC 12. +
Success: they see the goblins and can surprise them. +
Failure: standard combat encounter.

*Standard?* +
The goblins roll a stealth check vs the passive perception of the players. +
Success: the goblins surprise the players. +
Failure: standard combat encounter.

The adventurers have tracked the goblins through the forest and discovered their hideout. The hideout appears to be an ancient ruin, an old structure infested by the goblins recently. Any players who decide to monitor the hilltop before approaching will spot two goblins patrolling the area. This is a good time to check if the Player Characters are sneaking as they make their approach. 

Determining Surprise Before you begin a combat encounter, you must first determine who, if anyone, is Surprised. If anyone was attempting to be sneaky, prior to the encounter, have them roll a Dexterity (Stealth) Ability Check against a DC set by Passive Perception (10 + the Wisdom Modifier) each creature on the opposing side. A creature actively searching for another creature will roll a Wisdom (Perception) check against the Dexterity (Stealth) roll of the other creature. If neither side attempts to be stealthy, they notice each other at the same time. A surprised creature cannot take an action or move on their first turn. They cannot take a reaction until after their first turn ends.

If any of the adventurers are spotted, the goblins will ready their bows and will not be surprised when the combat begins. After the first round, every time a goblin takes a turn, check to see if they have taken any damage. If they have taken damage, or their buddy was slain, the goblin will retreat to warn its brethren inside the tomb. Until the goblin is either dead, or inside, they will spend their movement retreating and their action firing arrows back at the adventurers. If the goblin patrol survives long enough, you might have him shout a warning to the goblins guarding the entrance of the tomb. If this happens, the Player Characters are in range to see that the guards leave their posts to retreat into the tomb. The guards have gone to alert the others of the danger coming their way.

=== Area 2 - Arrival at the Tomb
Long ago, when the Helvetican empire ruled, a knight by the name of Delius founded the Delian Order and together they devoted their lives to the fight against Whirotepua (chief deity of the goblinoids / orc pantheon). This is their resting place, long forgotten. Today, the goblins who have infested the tomb are preparing to desecrate the site with a human sacrifice. It is their intent to consecrate the tomb in the name of Whirotepua.

Whirotepua is depicted as a powerful and ruthless warrior, with the head of a great black-furred wolf and the body of a muscular goblinoid. He is known as the Mighty One and the High Chieftain, and is worshipped by his followers as a god of war, conquest, and domination. Whirotepua is typically worshipped through blood sacrifices and acts of violence, and his followers often seek to expand their territories and conquer new lands.

People who follow Ohm consider Whirotepua as the devil. The god that opposes civilization, as goblinoids are usually the ones infringing on civilization.

=== Area 3 - Entrance
*DC of 13*

*Goblins are NOT alerted:* +
> Two goblins stand guard before the sundered, stone doors of the tomb. 

*Goblins are alerted:* +
> You see the sundered, stone doors of the tomb. There does not seem to be anything in sight.

If this happens, the Player Characters are in range to see that the guards leave their posts to retreat into the tomb. The guards have gone to alert the others of the danger coming their way.

*Stealth?* +
Roll a Dexterity (Stealth) Ability Check against DC 12. +
Success: they see the goblins and can surprise them. +
Failure: standard combat encounter. +
Goblins will flee inside after 1 round.

*Extra* +
As the Player Characters approach the guards, it would be a good idea to ask them once again if they are attempting to be sneaky. If they are, ask them to roll a Stealth Check against the goblin guards' Passive Perception. It's also possible for the Player Characters to simply use the geometry of the ruins to sneak up on the unwitting guards, easily gaining a Surprise Round when they initiate the combat. On the goblins' first turn of combat, they will both attempt to retreat inside. The presence of the adventurers tells them that the patrol was killed, and they aren't going to stand around awaiting that same fate! After the adventurers have dispatched the goblin guards, they descend into the tomb itself. Remember to describe the tomb using as many senses as seem reasonable to you.

*About the entrance* +
> As you approach the entrance of the Delian Tomb, you can see the weathered stone archway standing before you, its surface covered in patches of moss and tangled vines. The touch of time has left cracks and worn edges on the stone, giving it a rough texture under your fingertips.

include::{rootdir}/statblocks/goblin.adoc[]

=== Area 4 - Offering Room
*DC of 13*

*Show the map once they get to the entrance.*
> It's very dark as you move down the steps and into the tomb, the musty air cools by the step. You can hear faint, rhythmic chatter echoing up from the heart of the structure. Suddenly a high pitch scream.

Once the goblins are dealt with, take a moment to describe the room.

> The brazier at the center of this room gently illuminates the walls. On one side, a detailed carving depicts a company of knights fighting back a torrent of goblins! On the other wall, there is an inscription, it reads: "I swear to fight chaos in all of its forms, to uphold order, by honor of my word"

*In the room:*

* The number of goblins in this room should be equal to 1+ the number of Player Characters.
* Sneak past the patrol? Add 2 extra goblins after round 1.

The goblins have begun their ritual, the distant chatter is the chanting of a goblin shaman. At the bottom of the stairs, a dim light illuminates a large room littered with moldy bedrolls and goblins! Additionally, if the players managed to sneak past the goblin patrol without ever alerting them, they too will join the fight after the first round of combat. If the players have managed to deal with both the patrol and the guards, without allowing them to retreat into the tomb to warn the others — the players have the opportunity to catch these goblins by surprise. If, on the other hand, both sides are aware of the other, be prepared for the players to try some out of the box thinking. They may not want to venture into a den of goblins, they may instead try to flush them out. Be prepared for anything. Let the players experiment. In fact, encourage it!

=== Area 5 - Pressure Plate Trap
*DC of 12*

The next room lies beyond a twisting corridor that fades into darkness beyond the light of of brazier. Halfway down the corridor, just before the turn, there lies a pressure plate trap.

A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check will notice the trap, the faint light of the brazier just barely catching the raised bit of floor. If a character then succeeds on a DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, they can disable the trap without triggering it. This can also be attempted with any bladed weapon, but the check is made at disadvantage.

Additionally, if there are any Small sized Player Characters (Halflings, Gnomes) they won't trigger the trap. Any other creature who steps on the pressure plate will trigger the trap, causing a scythe to sweep down from the ceiling. The character who triggered the trap must succeed a on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 1d8 slashing damage. Once the trap has either been disabled, or triggered it is exhausted and will not be triggered again.

=== Area 6 - Hall of the Oathkeeper
> Dominated by a giant stone statue of a knight, raised up on a dais, standing tall with their sword point down between their feet. A thick haze billows up from a makeshift altar in the center of the room where a goblin adorned with jewelry and warpaint chants rhythmically while they rock back and forth. Behind the goblin, a young girl quietly whimpers, head in her hands, from a small cage near the foot of the statue.

After the fight, when investigating the statue:
> If you are to keep this, you must first give it to me.

*In the room*
* The makeshift altar is covered with bits of charcoal, cork, sulfur, and other spellcasting materials. Amidst these accoutrements there are two potions of healing.
* Near the cage where Bess was being held a few dozen gold pieces and gemstones worth 2d20 + 10 gp.

*Information* +
What was once the sacred chamber consecrated by the Delian Order on behalf of Lord Delius has been desecrated by the goblins. Along with the goblin shaman the leader of this band of miscreants resides here, a bugbear. This is the first time the players have encountered a clever enemy, the bugbear is not driven by fear like his goblin toadies. It will fight tactically, it might even have a potion of healing!

Once the monsters have been slain, and Bess has been helped out from the cage, the players will likely wish to search the room. The makeshift altar is covered with bits of charcoal, cork, sulfur, and other spellcasting materials. Amidst these accoutrements there are two potions of healing. Near the cage where Bess was being held, there is a large nest of blankets where the bugbear slept. The nest is littered with a few dozen gold pieces and gemstones worth 2d20 + 10 gp.

The statue of Delius has an inscription at the base, it reads: If you are to keep this, you must first give it to me. If any character speaks, "I give my word" — or anything in the spirit of that — the secret door leading to the tomb will open!

=== Area 7 - Tomb of the Delian Order
The true resting place of the Delian Order, hidden away behind the Hall of the Oathkeeper. Inside, there are six sarcophagi bearing the resemblances of their knights they hold. As well as a much larger, more elaborately carved sarcophagus at the center, bearing the form of Lord Delius. Each of the sarcophagi have the names of their occupants etched at their feet. There is a journal, mostly rotted away, laying atop Delius' sarcophagus. It is written in Common, and what can be read explains the origin of the Delian Order and their purpose. There are also a number of potions of healing scattered about the tomb, left as offerings to the Order long ago.

If any character attempts to open a sarcophagi, they will disturb the spirits of the Delian Order. Righteous skeletons will emerge from the sarcophagi, eager to expel the desecrators from their tomb. One exception being, in the event that the character who attempts to open a sarcophagi is a Paladin who has sworn the Delian Oath, for they are a member of the Delian Order. The treasures are theirs by holy right! Each sarcophagi holds chainmail, as well as a longsword, and a shield bearing the Coat of Arms of the Delian Order. Delius' sarcophagus hold chainmail, and a shield bearing the Delian crest, as well as the Golbin Slayer Longsword.

* Pacal will, only after they ask, give them eternal gratitude for saving his daughter (and max 10 GP) 
* Pacal will propose to sell them weapons based on cost
* Gundren disposition to the party will diminish if he knows they asked for gold

If the heroes save Bess, the town will wilcome them as heroes. They will be allowed to stay in the inn for free that night, including board and food.

== The Silverspine Roads

=== Introduction
After returning the girl Bess to her village our rat catchers are hailed as heroes. The merchant they saved proposes they protect the cargo to Loukotokia and to the Gundren's estate there. They will pass the Silverpine Watch gate where everthing is not as it should. If they solve the problems of the watch, they will arrive at the Gundren's estate. From which you can continue to the next adventure.

=== On the road again
Afterwards they meet with Gudrun in the Stonehill Inn who offers them a job guarding Gudrun back to town. If the players ask about what sort of dangers they might face or if there is anything specific the merchant is worried about:

> Traveling is becoming more dangerous by the day. Even on the kings roads. No one travels without a weapon and no one travels alone if they can afford not to. Some lords try to keep the roads clear. There are watchtowers and fortresses protecting important routes. But bandits and robbers are a constant threat. There is an influx in dangerous monsters attacking travelers as well.

*About Gundren* +
As DM keep track of Gundren's disposition towards the party. Gundren is so far really fond of the adventurers as they saved him. But that does not mean he has to keep liking the heroes. During the adventure, the heroes might do things to sour his opinion of them. Adjust your portrayal of Gundren to match his opinion of the heroes. He will not sabotage the heroes, but he will act impatient, short-tempered, brusque, grumpy, or even with-hold information from them.

*About the money.* +
Gudrun is offering each hero 5 gold pieces for seeing them safely to the city of Loukotokia. 

* This is good pay for a group of inexperienced adventurers staying fairly close to civilized lands. Most commoners earn about a silver piece a day and, given the length of the trip, Gudrun is paying the heroes about five times that.
* If the players decide that is not enough and want to try for a better deal, which players will sometimes do on principle, he will increase the pay to 6 gold pieces “and not a copper more.” The negotiation will diminish Gudrun's disposition toward the party.

*Making Travel Preparations.* +
Point out that each hero has a ten-day supply of trail rations and a waterskin they can refill from the many springs, creeks, and ponds they will pass.

*About the Goods.* +
Gudrun has a haphazard mix of goods in his cart. He has some bolts of wool and canvas, a few pots and pans, some casks of mead and wine, cut wooden staves, a few iron ingots, a few inexpensive trinkets, and mining equipment. As it is early spring, there is no fruit or vegetables, but there are a few sacks of rye, some pickled fish in a barrel, and some salted pork. It is exactly the sort of stuff a peddler like her would have in his cart. This was bought in the towns general store.

> You are gathered on the townsquare. It is just after dawn; the weather is gloomy. The merchant is getting his cart ready. The dwarf’s cart is half-full of bundles, barrels, crates, and sacks. Two shaggy, miniature horses are harnessed to the cart already. One is solid gray while the other has dark spots over a light coat: Dapple and Mist. He hops up onto the bench at the front of the cart and snaps the reigns and spurs Dapple and Mist, her horses, to a walk. The cart trundles through the gate.

=== The Forest Road

image::{homedir}/assets/maps/silverpine_2_road_combat_custom.png[align=center]

> Silverpine Forest is a heavy, mixed-growth forest covering the Aster river valley and the foothills of upper Asternia north-west of Loukotokia. In the lowlands, the forest is thick with broadleaf trees like willows, alders, poplars, and oaks interspersed with evergreen spruces and the whitebark pines from which the forest gets its name. In the uplands, where most of this part of the adventure takes place, the terrain consists of rough, forested hills. There are fewer shrubs and ground cover here, fewer broadleaf trees, and more evergreens.

> It is springtime. The evergreen trees are bare or budding. The road is muddy from rain and snow melt. The party passes streams and rivulets frequently. The forest’s natural fauna is active, but skittish and Gundren's cart is noisy. The party might see robins, sparrows, or finch-es in the trees or hear a woodpecker tapping away. They might startle a rabbit or pheasant or catch sight of a red deer darting away between the trees. At night, they might hear the cries of owls or night thrushes or the distant howls of wolves.

> The Silverpine Road is a narrow, dirt track. In a few places, there are just a pair of furrows left by the passage of countless carts in the weeds. The road winds back and forth, following the contours of the land. In the uplands, it climbs gradually upward, winding between steep hills, sometimes following steep bluffs or sheer, bare rock faces.

> It has been two days since you left Kainga. It is a mid-spring morning and the sky is gray. The weather is breezy and chilly as it is early spring. The narrow dirt road winds back and forth between rolling, forested hills. Gundren is driving Mist and Dapple at a comfortable pace. Gundren is sociable, easy to laugh, and good at small-talk. He talks about finding the fabled Echo caves. In fact it is really only what he talks about. He knows all the stories.

*About the Echo Caves* +
More than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelver's Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. The mine had great deposits of mineral wealth. Times were good, and the nearby human town of Phandalin (pronounced fan-duh-lin) prospered as well. But then disaster struck when orcs swept through the North and laid waste to all in their path and the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost. For centuries, rumors of buried riches have attracted treasure seekers and opportunists to the area around Phandalin, but no one has ever succeeded in locating the lost mine.

=== The Accident
> The road is a dirt track overgrown with weeds here. It is about 10 feet wide. Scattered trees by the roadside can provide cover. Thick underbrush grows between the trees which constitutes difficult terrain.

> It is mid-afternoon. The weather is gray and chilly and the road muddy. Gundren is driving Mist and Dapple at a comfortable walking pace and keeps talking about Echo Cave. When you round a bend in the road Dapple and Mist suddenly give a frightened whinnies and rear up. The cart lurches as the veer sharply for the side of the road. The cart suddenly stops when its wheel becomes stuck in a muddy rut at the side of the road. Dapple and Mist scream and struggle against the cart. Gundren were thrown of the cart and strikes his head and falls unconscious. 

*When the horses are calm, Gundren is stable or conscious, and the cart is free, the encounter is over.* +
Based on the travel order, decide which way the cart lurches such that it threatens to strike at least one hero. It is most likely to strike heroes walking alongside it, but if there is no one beside the cart, it hits a hero ahead of it. 

Both the unconscious halfling and the panicked horses are emergencies. The heroes should not ignore them. If the heroes seem unsure of what to do, if they are slow to act, or if they ignore either problem, describe how the horse’s struggles are damaging the cart or how Gundren is not moving and she is getting paler by the moment.

TIP: [small]#After you call for action, wait for one of the players to describe their hero’s action. Do not resolve the action right away. Instead, repeat it to the party. Then ask the other players what they would like to do at the same time. “Alice’s character is tending to Gundren. Bob, does your character do something while she’s doing that?” Note what each hero is doing. Once everyone is doing something, or they have declined to take action, resolve each player’s action in turn. Then, ask for a new round of actions.#

==== Call for action

* _EMERGENCY_: Avoid being struck
* _EMERGENCY_: Gundren is laying motionless in the road. Blood is pooling around her head. She might have a serious injury and will need help quickly.
* _EMERGENCY_: Dapple and Mist are struggling against their harnesses; the cart is creaking and groaning. If they are not calmed quickly, they might break the harnesses or hurt themselves.
* The snake? There is no obvious sign of anything that might have panicked the horses.
* The cart’s wheel is stuck in a muddy rut at the edge of the road. Until it is freed, there is no going anywhere.

==== Avoid being struck
*DC of 11*

* Gundren and any hero riding on the cart are thrown off
* Any hero riding on the cart is thrown from the cart as well.

Heroes struck can dodge the cart Dexterity Saving Throw DC 11. +
Failure: The hero is clipped by the cart and takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage.

==== The Snake
A common adder was basking in the road. The heroes overlooked it due to its camouflage and the horses nearly stepped on it. The snake is afraid of the party and easily driven off, so it will not attack unless a hero gets too close without seeing it and startles it. Then the snake will strike before slithering away. The snake is not a dangerous combatant, they can kill the snake without issue.

* *Wisdom (Perception)* «Passive» DC of 18 The hero spots the motionless, gray-and-brown snake in the road.
* *Intelligence (Nature)* «No Action» DC of 12 The snake is a common adder. The snake is two feet long, two inches thick. It’s pebbly skin is mottled gray and brown. It was probably just trying to warm itself when the horses nearly stepped on. The snake is venomous, but not deadly to humanoids.

TIP: Grant rangers or druids advantage on the check to identify it.

If a hero examines the wound from the snake’s bite, they can determine the following: Wisdom (Medicine) «Requires Proficiency» DC 11 the bite is swollen and painful, but not life threatening. The swelling should go down soon, and the bitten hero will not suffer any long-term effects.

include::{rootdir}/statblocks/snake_poisonous.adoc[]

==== Calming the horses
Dapple and Mist are panicking. Their struggles threaten to break their harness, damage the cart, or injure them. If the heroes ignore the horses, describe the creaks and groans coming from the cart. Make it seem like an emergency.

If Gundren is conscious, he can calm Dapple and Mist automatically. No ability check is needed.

* *Wisdom (Animal Handling)* +
«Advantage: offering the horses an apple or other food» +
«Disadvantage: The Snake has not Been Driven Off» +
DC 10 Dapple and Mist stop struggling and calm down. +
Failure The horses continue to thrash and struggle.

Each time the heroes fail describe the increased strain on the harness or cart. After 3 failed attempts they brake the equipment and escape in the forest. Easy Skill Challenge: 4 Successes over 3 failures allowed.

====
Objective:

    This represents their efforts in finding and calming down their horses in the forest.
    Success: they lose a few hours but can continue their journey.
    Failure: they lose the horses and must leave the cart.

Rules:

    The heroes can't use the same skill twice in a row.
    The heroes can't use the same skill that another hero has just used.
    The heroes need to accumulate 4 Successes over 3 failures allowed.

Sample Skill Checks:

    Survival: The heroes track the hoofprints and signs of their horses through the underbrush.
    Nature: The heroes recognize signs of horse behavior in the forest and can predict their likely paths.

    Perception: The heroes spot a glint of sunlight on a horse's tack deep within the forest.
    Investigation: The heroes discover broken branches and disturbances indicating a path the horses might have taken.
    Acrobatics: The heroes navigate through tricky terrain to reach a clearing where they may be able to spot their horses.

==== Tending to Gundren
If a hero goes to tend to Gundren wounds
> Gundren struck his head as he fell from the cart. He is unconscious and bleeding from a cut on his head. 

* *Wisdom (Medicine)* +
«Automatic Success: Healer’s Kit» +
DC 10 and Gundren is stabilized and stops bleeding and no longer makes death saving throws. +
Stabilizing Gundren does not return her to consciousness! Throw a 1d4 to see when Gundren regains consciousness.

Once one of the heroes has checked on Gundren, roll a d20 where the players cannot see the result, make a grim face, and make a note on your scratch paper. Gundren is making death saving throws. Make another one each time the party takes a round of actions. After Gundren makes five death saving throws, he dies.

Do not actually keep track of the results, though. Since this is a tutorial encounter, Gundren cannot actually die. After you have made a death saving throw for Gundren, Keep track of how many saving throws you have made. 

==== Searching the Cart
It might occur to the heroes to root through Gundren's cart and look for something to help them deal with the situation.

*Wisdom (Perception) DC 10* +
The hero turns up either a small bag of lumpy green horse apples or a healer’s kit. Determine which randomly unless the hero specified they were looking for medical supplies or feed for the horses. A second search will yield the other item if successful.

The heroes can keep the healer’s kit. If the heroes ask Gundren about it, she will gladly let them have it. +
But, make a note if the party keeps the kit without mentioning it to Gundren.

==== Freeing the Cart
The cart’s wheel is stuck in a muddy ditch at the side of the road. One or more of the heroes can push the cart free:

*Strength* +
«Advantage: Multiple Heroes Work Together» +
«Disadvantage: The Horses Are Still Panicked» DC 20 +
The cart’s wheel is freed from the muddy rut. If the horses are calm, they can pull the cart free:

*Charisma (Handle Animal)* +
«Advantage: Offered Horse Apple or Similar Food» DC 10 The horse’s pull the cart free of the muddy rut.

==== Move On
*When the horses are calm, Gundren is stable or conscious, and the cart is free, the encounter is over.* +
If Gundren is conscious, he suggests the party rest for an hour. +
If the party does not rest, note of who is driving the cart if Gundren is unconscious.

=== A Short Rest
*Optional*

After being thrown from the cart, Gundren is either unconscious or shaken and several of the heroes might be hurt. 

* If a hero was bitten by the snake, remind them about the painful, swollen wound.
* If a hero was thrown from or struck by the cart, remind them of their bumps and bruises.
* Remind the party of Gundren status; is she fully healed, conscious, or unconscious.
* The horses are browsing in the roadside brush; they look around nervously?

*Nervous Horses*
The horses are still shaken from their panic, but they are also aware of the pack of feral dogs stalking through the un-derbrush nearby. As you set the scene and describe the short rest, mention their nervousness a couple of times in pass-ing. Subtle repetition of important details is a helpful way of foreshadowing current events.If a hero tries to soothe the horses, resolve the action with an ability check. If the players decide to look around, skip the short rest and move on to B5 Feral Dogs.

*Short Rest*

====
A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.

A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character’s level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.

Player’s Handbook, pg. 186 
====

If Gundren is conscious, interact with the heroes and try to start a conversation while everyone is resting. If no one wants to talk, stretch out the rest with some narration. Describe the forest scene, describe the characters tending their wounds or eating rations, the horses being nervous, that sort of thing.

*Move On* +
After the party completes the short rest, Gundren climbs into the back of the cart to check her goods before the party resumes their travels. The heroes take up their positions in the travel order. If the party claimed the healer’s kit in The Accident,  he notices that it is gone. He does not say anything, but her disposition toward the party is diminished. After checking her goods, Gundren climbs onto the cart’s bench and snaps the reigns, but Dapple and Mist just whinny nervously.

TIP: There is an art to foreshadowing. If you want the players to notice something, say it thrice +
Ask for perception roles or if the players want to check out why the horses are nervous?

=== Feral Dogs

> Dapple and Mist keep acting nervous while Gundren tries to get them moving. A calculated rustling among the underbrush reveals the approach of three feral dogs, they are large, but skinny, mangy, and scarred. Their predatory instincts honed to exploit any vulnerabilities. With uncanny precision, the dogs position themselves with caution, flanking the adventurers and preparing for an ambush. Suddenly the dogs spring forth, their movements swift and coordinated, lunging towards their prey with fierce determination.

==== Call to Action
* The feral dogs are starving, mad, attack immediately and will fight to the death. The dogs emerge onto the road 30 feet ahead of the heroes.
* Gundren keeps the horses under control. If Gundren is unconscious, some-one else will have to keep the horses from panicking again. Gundren uses his turn in combat to keep Dapple and Mist from panicking.
* Remind the players that Gundren is either on the cart’s bench or unconscious in the cart
* The dogs are no longer domesticated; they have gone feral. They are starving, and they attack immediately. They are not likely to respond to attempts to calm them. However, if one of the players comes up with a clever plan to calm the dogs or drive them off, resolve it using your own best judgment. The feral dogs focus all their attention on the heroes. Unless the heroes ignore them completely, they will not go after Gundren or the horses.

==== Encounter

*Intelligence (Nature)* +
«No Action» «Proficiency Required» +
DC 10 The dogs look like hunting dogs gone feral. +
Their master must have died or abandoned them, and they have been struggling to survive in the wild. They are not powerful, but they’re desperate enough to attack the party. 

include::{rootdir}/statblocks/dog_feral.adoc[]

==== The Horses
The feral dogs frighten Gundren’s horses, Dapple and Mist. Someone must keep Dapple and Mist under control, or else the horses will bolt.If no one tries to keep the horses under control or the at-tempt to control them fails, the horses panic. When the horses panic, describe their attempts to break free and run as you did in The Accident. Make it seem like the harnesses are going to break any moment, or the horses are going to bolt, or one of the horses is going to get hurt. Make it seem urgent. But do not actually have anything happen unless you want to.If Gundren is conscious, he uses her action each turn to control the horses. No ability check is needed.

If Gundren is unconscious, any hero can use an action on their turn to keep the horses from panicking that round:

*Charisma (Handle Animal)* +
DC 10 The horses are kept from panicking for one round. +
Failure: The horses panic.If the players are ignoring the horses and you feel up to im-provising, have the horses bolt, trampling the heroes and the dogs on the road ahead. +
Use Dexterity saving throws to see who can dodge out of the way and apply appropriate damage to anyone who does not. If one of the heroes gives chase, they can catch up to the cart. +
Use ability checks to see if they can jump onto the cart and regain control as appropriate. If the heroes do not catch the cart themselves, Dapple and Mist eventually calm down and come to a stop further up the road.

==== Move On
Once the last dog is dead or driven off, silence falls over the road. Although it is only mid-afternoon, the shadow of the forest hangs over the road. A frustrated Gundren suggests that the party just make camp for the night and start fresh in the morning and he will brook no argument this time. When the party is ready to rest for the night.

=== Making Camp
> "It is late afternoon, people" says Gundren. "Time to make camp. After dealing with everything today; accidents, injuries, and feral dogs; I would say I need to get a good night’s rest. Wasn't anybody bitten by a snake? I had it, lets look for a good place to camp."

The terrain makes it impossible to move the cart and the horses off the road. You are forced to make their camp at the side of the road as you have done for the last several nights of travel. If the players seem engaged, ask them what sort of activities their heroes are getting up to. 

* Firewood, food and water
* Who tends to the horses
* Setup a night watch?

> While you are setting around the campfire, Gundren casually mentions that the party will probably pass through Silverpine Watch sometime the next day. Silverpine Watch is a gatehouse that protects the road.

If the players ask about the watch (If they are feeling talkative, play it out. Otherwise, just narrate the information):

* Gundren's route goes through this watch a few times a year, and he has met the Watch’s commander, a knight named Sir Arpaad. He respects him as fair, just, and honest, but also does not like him very much. He is probably a good knight, in his estimation, but he is not very friendly.
* Gundren does like Bartoz. He is built like a bear, he says, but he is friendly and helpful. He runs the Watch’s forge and keeps their supplies. In years past, he and Gundren have exchanged goods and, last year, he repaired his cart’s har-ness for free.
* Gundren does not know any of the dozen soldiers by name; he never stays long at Silverpine Watch. He just pays his toll tax and continues on her way. 

> The next day dawns chilly and gray. You wakes up and breaks down the camp. Gundren harnesses Dapple and Mist, checks his goods, and then resumes her position on the cart’s bench. The rest of the heroes take up their positions *in the travel order. -ASK-* spurs Dapple and Mist to a walk and the party is underway again.

=== The Tinkers Body
> It is morning; the weather is gloomy and chilly. The forest is rugged and hilly as the cart passes around the bends of a sheer, rocky hillside. Gundren calls out to a lumpy furry mass in the road fifty feet in front of them. A human body in a furred cloak. Gundren reins Dapple and Mist to a stop.

If none of the heroes act, Gundren will tell whoever is in the lead to check out the body. Otherwise, Gundren will leave the heroes to investigate the scene and wait until they are done. He also does not want to leave the body in the road. If the party refuses to investigate or bury the body, Gundren disposition toward the party is diminished. He will not travel with the body. He does not want to be haunted by an angry spirit.

==== Approaching the body
From a distance, the party can only confirm that the mass in the road looks like a human body lying face down beneath a thick, fur-covered traveling cloak. As they approach, the heroes might note the following:

*Intelligence (Nature)* +
«No Action» «Requires Proficiency» +
DC 10 It is odd that the body has not attracted scavenging beasts or carrion birds.

*Intelligence (Religion)* +
«No Action» «Requires Proficiency» +
DC 10 An unburied, abandoned body can be dangerous. If sentient beings are not laid to rest properly, their bodies or spirits can rise as undead monsters. Especially if they died in a sudden or traumatic way. +

*Wisdom (Perception)* +
«Passive» +
DC 15 The character notices the tinker’s tracks in the road as described below. Gundren’s superstitions or their own conclusions might make the heroes nervous. As such, they might want to take precautions as they approach the body. Let them do so, but take note of anything the heroes do to damage the body as they approach, such as peppering it with arrows or launching spells at it. If the heroes damage the body, it will make their investigation more difficult.

==== The Body
> The tinker’s body is currently lying face down in the road. It is wearing a torn, furred cloak over drab, travelers’ clothes.

The party cannot determine anything more without turning over the body and making a careful examination. Once a hero turns over and inspects the body, they notice that

> The corpse’s skin is unnaturally pale and grayish white. They do not see any signs of injury.

Heroes who inspect or examine the body might also note the following:

*Intelligence (Investigation)* +
«Requires Proficiency» +
DC 10 Though his cloak and clothes are ripped, there is no blood staining them. Or on the ground around him. +
DC 15 Based on his clothing and that he is not armed or armored, he is a traveler not a soldier. He is at least five days from town. He should have some traveling supplies. He does not even seem to have a backpack.

*Wisdom (Medicine)* +
«Requires Proficiency» +
DC 10 His oddly pale skin, the lack of blood on his clothes, and the lack of bruising suggests the man’s body has been completely drained of blood. DC 15: He has a half-dozen puncture wounds in his back, shoulders, and legs. They are difficult to spot because of the lack of swelling or discoloration.

*Wisdom (Perception)* +
«Advantage: Specify Searching for Wounds or Cause of Death» +
DC 15 The body has a half-dozen puncture wounds in his back, shoulders, and legs. They are difficult to spot because of the lack of swelling, discoloration, or bleeding.

==== The Trail
The heroes might notice the signs of the tinker’s passage in the road, might turn them up with a search of the road around the body, or they might specifically search for tracks and signs of passage. If they do so, they might discover the following:

*Wisdom (Perception)* +
«Passive» +
DC 15 There are scuff marks and disturbed weeds in the road near the body, marking the man’s passage.

*Wisdom (Survival)* +
«Requires Proficiency» +
«Advantage: Signs of Passage Already Noticed» +
DC 10 From the signs in the road, it looks like the man was coming from further up the road. Probably within the last day.
DC 15 It looks like the man was running all out, but was stumbling and off balance. The hero can follow the man’s trail up the road

==== Up the Road
If the heroes move fifty feet up the road from the body, possibly while following the tinker’s trail, they might notice the following clues that will lead them to the tinker’s discarded backpack:

*Wisdom (Perception)* +
«Passive» +
DC 15 The undergrowth off the road’s left side looks like it has been disturbed by something passing through it.

*Wisdom (Survival)* +
«Requires Proficiency» +
«Requires Already Following the Tinker’s Trail» +
«No Action» +
DC 15 It looks like the man was running from further up the road but had some kind of struggle here. He staggered and stumbled and then lurched toward the left side of the road before he running to where he fell.

*Detect Magic* +
There is a magical presence, but it cannot be pinpointed. It is coming from the healing potion in the man’s backpack.If a hero approaches the left edge of the road, they will spot the man’s backpack in the brush without issue.

==== The Backpack
The tinker’s backpack lies in the brush where he threw it. The leather backpack is scratched and has several surface tears. A hero handling it, or one standing nearby, might note the following:

*Intelligence (Investigation)* +
«No Action» +
«Requires Proficiency» +
DC 10 It looks like something with lots of small claws or burrs got caught on the backpack and was then torn free. The tinker’s discarded, leather backpack contains: +
» A week’s worth of trail rations, a waterskin, and normal traveling supplies +
» Scraps of tin, a set of tinker’s tools, and a whetstone for sharpening blades +
» A small, polished brass candlestick that looks valuable +
» A glass vial containing a paler shade of red sticky liquid (healing potion).

The brass candlestick is a valuable treasure. Tell the party that its common knowledge among adventurers that the sweet, pale red liquid in the vial is a healing potion. 

==== Burying the Body
The heroes can bury the body in the forest off the road or raise a cairn of rocks over it. Gundren can lend the party a shovel and a woodcutter’s axe from her cart. It takes an hour of work, during which the party is not disturbed. A character with proficiency in the Religion skill can perform proper burial rites.

There are no specific consequences for not burying the body unless you want to invent some. Gundren’s superstitious fear of the body and the information about bodies sometimes rising as undead help to set up the party’s later encounters with the undead in Silverpine Watch. 

==== Moving On
Once the heroes are finished with their investigation and the body has been dealt with, the party resumes their travel order and Gundren climbs back on the cart. Uneasily, Gundren gives a half-hearted snap of the reins and travel resumes.

== The Silverpine Watch

=== Arrival at Silverpine Watch

image::{homedir}/assets/maps/silverpine_3_watch_elevation.png[align=center]

> It is mid-morning; the day is growing chillier and the narrow road winds between steep-sided, wooded hills. The Silverpine Watch’s  forty-foot wall stretches across the road between two watchtowers built into the hills. A black iron portcullis blocks the road’s passage through the wall. The Watch is silent; no soldiers are visible near the gate nor atop the towers. The forest around the Watch is equally still and eery silent. Silverpine Watch is a gatehouse built across the road with a square watchtower at either end. The wooded hills make it impossible for carts, draft animals, or large groups to get around the Watch.

* You can show map silverpine_3_watch_exterior.
* You can show map silverpine_3_watch_elevation.

* If the party peers through the arrow slits, they will find the interior dark and empty.

If the players ask for more information about the Watch.

> The towers are built into the hills flanking the road; the tops of the hillsides are level with each tower’s second story. The Watch is made of masonry, plastered and whitewashed, though the exterior is faded and cracked with age, showing the masonry beneath. The western tower is the taller of the two, at fifty feet high. The masonry wall is about thirty feet tall; the wall has a wooden structure called a hoarding built atop it to protect soldiers. Essentially, the wooden walls and roof turn the top of the wall into a covered walkway. There are narrow windows called arrow slits looking out onto the road at the base of the wall.

The group does not travel for long after they leave the tinker’s body before they round a bend and see Silverpine Watch stretched across the road ahead. The Watch’s gates are down, making travel impossible. Gundren orders one of the heroes to call out for the guards, but there is no response. The party can scout the area and locate the Watch’s entrance, but they will find no way to get the 
cart and the horses around the Watch. Ultimately, the heroes will have to prepare to enter the Watch. 

==== West Side Door
CAUTION: Do not point this out until the party deliberately looks for a way in.

The only entrance to the Watch is a reinforced, oak door with heavy iron bands on the western side of the western tower where the tower meets the top of the hill. 

==== The Gates
The wall is nearly as thick as it is tall, and the road goes through a ten-foot-wide passage in it called a neck. Portcullises block either end of the neck. These are gates made of iron bars and crossbars that must be lifted out of the way. Each portcullis weighs over a thousand pounds and it would be impossible for the heroes to lift the gates high enough or hold them open long enough for the cart and horses to pass through.

Gundren is still disturbed by the body in the road and now he is even more troubled.

* The Watch’s gates are rarely closed. 
* During the day, there’s usually soldiers keeping watch on the road and ready to collect toll-taxes.
* There is also usually a soldier watching from atop one of the towers.

If none of the players take action, Gundren tells whoever is in the front to approach the Watch and call for the guard. *Gundren is growing impatient and frustrated.* Feel free to portray her as such throughout this en-counter. Especially if her disposition toward the party is already diminished.

==== Calling Out To The Watch
Calling out to the watch elicits no response. Nor does calling into the arrow slits. After a hero has tried to get someone’s attention a few times, Gundren grows impatient and hops down off the cart. He begins pacing up and down along the wall shouting for Bartoz or Sir Arpaad.

When he gets no response, he crosses her arms and sinks into sullen silence. Let the moment hang there for a few seconds and wait for a player to say something. 

If none of the heroes act, Gundren gets annoyed. He orders them to “look around or something.” he will remind them he hired them to get him to Loukotokia and that means they will have to find a way through.

Try to allow the party to conclude that they will have to enter the Watch and look for survivors or find a way to raise the gates themselves. If the players are truly stumped and have no idea how to proceed, though, have Gundren tell them to look for a way inside.

==== Preparing to Enter the Watch
Once the heroes have located the door and resolved to explore the Watch, Gundren will offer them some advice.

*First,*

* He tells the heroes to look for *survivors*.
* If they can find *Bartoz*, who’s workshop is at the base of the eastern tower, he will probably help them.
* If not, they should look for the knight who commanded the Watch, *Sir Einrik Arpaad*.

*Second,*

He tells the players that if they cannot find any survivors, they will have to *raise the gates themselves*. There are probably winches on either side of the gates, either above the gates or in the wall beside them.

*Third,*

he warns the players that if the Watch is truly abandoned, it is probably dark inside. They will need some kind of light source to see. If none of the heroes has a light source, he will give them a bundle of ten torches. Gundren will not offer the heroes anything else, but if they ask, he’ll let them take the woodcutter’s axe. When the heroes are ready to enter, ask the players which hero is going to be the one to open the door.

Gundren can offer: 

* A bundle of 10 torches
* A woodcutters axe (if they ask)

When one of the heroes pushes open the reinforced wooden door, it groans open. Sunlight spills into the darkness of the Watch interior...

=== Area 1 - Entry Hall [Main Floor]
The heroes enter Silverpine Watch through the only entrance, a door in the western tower’s main level. They find it dark, deserted, smelling of blood, and unnaturally cold. As the heroes file into the hall, the ghost of the Watch’s commander, Sir Einrik Arpaad appears. Afraid the heroes will discover that Arpaad murdered his garrison and afraid that it will end up hurting the heroes as well, the spirit commands them to leave before vanishing from the room. After the encounter, if the heroes cannot open the locked door in the eastern wall, they will have to descend the stairs to the lower level.

[IMPORTANT]
The room is dark; the heroes need a light source to see.

> The room is dark; There is a heavy door in the interior tower wall to the east. A flight of wooden stairs leads down from a doorway at the southern end of the hall.

==== Call to action
* Once all the players commit to entering the hall, describe the spirit’s sudden appearance. If they act upon it, move to <<The_Spirit>>.
* The door to east (C6) is locked.

==== The Spirit
If they do nothing, the spirit hangs in the air, still and silent, until the players act. If they take any other action, be it approaching, talking, or even preparing to attack, the spirit points to the tower’s exit and warns the heroes, and performs a limited version of the shriek attack.

=== Area 2 - Mess Hall [Basement]
The Watch’s garrison took their meals around a single long table in this hall, warmed by the two fireplaces in the eastern wall. When Sir Arpaad went mad, he surprised four soldiers gathered here and killed them all. Their bodies have risen as zombies and the party will have fight them around the mess table. Once they have done so, the heroes can find up the key to the door above if they search the room.

* The first hero (if he can see the zombies) can perform an intelligence check.
* When the first hero reaches the bottom of the stairs, the zombies become aware of them and will attack.

==== Encounter
The four Zombie Soldiers attack immediately and relentlessly. The dark spirits animating them despise the living and must destroy them. One zombie has an iron key on a ring hung on his belt. As you describe the action, mention the keyring at least twice. For example, you might describe it jingling when the zombie makes an attack and later mention how it clatters against the floor when the zombie falls.

The zombies cannot climb onto the table but can reach characters standing on it. The zombies cannot climb or jump onto the table. A zombie can pull a hero off the table as part of its movement if it is grappling the hero. The hero takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage and falls prone.

==== Searching the Room
Once the zombies are defeated, the heroes can make a survey of the room. The heroes should be aware of the iron key on one zombie’s belt. It opens the door between C1 Entry Hall and C6 Gathering Hall on the west tower’s main level. If they forget about it, remind them of it so they can retrieve it. The floor and the table are littered with debris from the soldier’s last meal. The foodstuffs have rotted away, but the broken tankards and tableware remain. Scattered amongst the debris are two notable items.

* Iron key on zombier S3 (Door for 1.Entry Hall to 6.Gathering hall).
* The broken tankards and tableware on the table

==== Move On
Aside from using the wooden stairs to climb back up the western tower’s main level and C1 Entry Hall, the heroes might open the plain wooden door to the west and visit C3 Kitchen or they might open the heavy eastern door and enter C5W West Gate Room.

=== Area 3 - Kitchen [Basement]
There is no fighting occurred in the Watch’s kitchen. The foodstuffs have rotted away or been picked over by rats. The party can search the shelves for valuables. Empty rooms in dungeons are like slow scenes in movies. They give the players' brains a chance to breathe. Since entering the Watch, the players have been threatened by a ghost and attacked by zombies. Now they've earned a chance to poke around at their leisure. And also a glimpse of the first of their two goals, the gate rooms.

[IMPORTANT]
The room is dark; the heroes need a light source to see.

> The room smells like rotted food. There is a large table, a wooden cluttered, wooden shelf, and a large cookpot hanging in the cold fireplace. There are plain doors in the southern and eastern walls.

The engraved drinking horn is a valuable treasure.

==== Move On
The plain door in the western wall leads back to C2 Mess Hall. Though it requires a hard shove to get it open, the plain wooden door to the south permits entry to C4 Pantry. 

=== Area 4 - Pantry [Basement]
There is nothing for the heroes to find and nowhere for the heroes to go from here except back to C3 Kitchen.

[IMPORTANT]
The room is dark; the heroes need a light source to see.

> The cold dark larder has been raided by rats and bugs and the hanging slabs of meat have rotted away, leaving only barbed hooks hanging by chains from the ceiling beams and a foul stink in the air.

=== Area 5 - West and East [Basement]
Built into the thirty-foot thick wall between the towers, these rooms allowed soldiers to raise and lower the gates at either end of the neck, the passage through the wall through which the road runs. Archers could also man the embrasures and fire into the neck or onto the road. With heroes present in both the gate rooms, the party can use the winches to raise the gates and allow Oona and her horses to pass through.

[IMPORTANT]
The room is  dimly lit.

> The room is dimly lit, daylight shines through the arrow slits in the archers’ embrasures. There are two huge winches built into the floor, one in the north corner and one in the south corner.

> Each winch consists of a large wooden drum, half sunk into the ground, and long wooden handles spaced around it. The winches are large enough that two people can work together to turn them. Two thick iron chains wrap around each winch’s drum. One snakes up to a hole in the ceiling where it runs along a channel and attaches to one of the Watch’s two gates. The other hangs into a shaft beneath the winch itself and connects to a massive counterweight.

> You quickly realize that to raise the gates, you will have to man both Gate Rooms and shout through the arrow slits to coordinate their efforts.

==== The Embrasures
An embrasure is a small alcove built into a wall. Each embrasure has a narrow, vertical window called an arrow slit. An archer could man an embrasure and cover a wide arc thanks to the tapered arrow slit. There are three embrasures built into each of the room’s three thick, exterior walls. The heroes can see Gundren though the southern arrow slits. They can even call her over and talk to her.

The heroes can see into the space where the road passes beneath the wall — called the neck — and, by the dim light filtering in through the portcullis, can see arrow slits in the opposite wall of the neck. If there are heroes in both gate rooms, they can shout to each other through the arrow slits to coordinate their activities.

==== The Winches
The counterweight is necessary because each iron portcullis weighs about 1,200 lbs. Thanks to the counterweight, a single person can operate each winch. Each winch also has a chock attached to a lever so the winch can be locked into place. Each of the two gates, the northern and the southern gate, has two winches attached to it, one in each Gate Room. 

To raise a gate, both winches must be operated simultaneously. To raise the gates, the heroes will have to man both Gate Rooms and shout through the arrow slits to coordinate their efforts. All this information is obvious to the heroes. This is not meant to be a puzzle. The characters can easily figure out how to operate the winches. The details are provided so that you can answer the players’ questions about the winches. 

Let the players investigate the winches. Describe them using whatever level of detail you think is best and answer their questions. Make sure they understand that these winches alone will not let them raise the gates. That there must be another set on the other side of the Watch. They will have to find them and ultimately to split their number between them.

If the heroes have not yet found the other Gate Room and consider splitting up now, warn them that they don’t know what dangers might lurk in the unexplored rooms of the Watch. Suggest they secure the route to the other Gate Room before they split up. Ultimately, the choice is theirs though.

==== Move On
Once they have finished exploring the Gate Room, the heroes can return to the room from which they came through the reinforced door.

=== Area 6 - Gathering Hall [Main floor]
Once, soldiers mustered here before leaving the Watch to patrol the road, to hunt, or to forage for supplies. Now, the hall is silent and empty and contains only the garrison’s abandoned cloaks and boots.

[IMPORTANT]
The room is dark; the heroes need a light source to see.

> This long hall is unfurnished. A A dozen or so heavy, furred cloaks hang from pegs along the eastern wall and a pair of thick, warm boots sits on the floor beneath each cloak. A flight of wooden stairs climbs up from a doorway at the 
northern end of the hall.

==== Cloak and boots
* They are not of exceptionally high quality, but they are warm and in good repair. Heroes can help themselves to new cloaks and boots if they want.
* The missing cloak is still stached in the chest of Dolf in his chest in C7 Barracks.

There are a total of eleven warm, fur-lined, hooded cloaks hanging on pegs on the wall and eleven pairs of heavy, furtopped boots. There is also one empty peg, its cloak missing, and an empty patch of floor where some boots should lie. The soldier, Piri, was wearing one of the cloaks and one pair of boots when Dolf killed him. Dolf originally intended to bring back Piri’s cloak and boots, but he realized that would disprove his story that Piri was dragged away by an owlbear.

Ultimately, he abandoned the boots in the woods, but his guilt over his crime and latent desire to confess — or to get caught — led him to keep the cloak. It is still stashed in his chest in C7 Barracks. They are not of exceptionally high quality, but they are 
warm and in good repair. Heroes can help themselves to new cloaks and boots if they want.

The heroes might think of gathering up the cloaks and boots for Gundren to sell or of selling them themselves. Either option is fine, but the whole collection is very bulky. Remind the players they can always gather them on their way out.

==== Move On
Apart from returning to C1 Entry Hall through the reinforced western door, the heroes only option is the climb the groaning flight of wooden stairs to C7 Barracks on the west tower’s upper level.

=== Area 7 - Barracks [Upper Level]
The Watch’s soldiers slept in this barracks, warmed by three fireplaces, and each soldier kept his possessions in a wooden trunk next to his bunk bed. Piri’s trunk still contains his meager personal effects which might raise a players’ eyebrows if they read the letter in C8 Marshal Brask’s Room. Dolf’s trunk contains the bloodstained cloak he took from Piri’s body after killing Piri and a handful of ancient coins he looted with the serpentine dagger from Berengar the Backstabber’s barrow.

After he killed Marshal Brask, Sir Einrik Arpaad came down the stairs into the barracks and slaughtered five of his soldiers where they lounged and rested. Caught by surprise, they had no chance against the knight. Later, after he killed Bartoz in C17 Workshop, the mortally wounded Arpaad passed through the barracks again on his way back up to his room, leaving signs of his passage.

The soldiers’ bodies have risen as zombies. After the heroes defeat the zombies, they might notice the bloodstains that Arpaad 
left behind. They can also ransack the trunks to turn up some valuables, some interesting clues, and a handful of ancient coins.

[IMPORTANT]
The room is dark; the heroes need a light source to see. +
Detect Magic. There is a magic present, but it cannot be pinpointed. It is coming from the healing potion in Wren’s trunk.

* There are brown stains on the floor and wall beside the door.

==== The Zombies
The five Zombie Soldiers attack immediately and relentlessly. The dark spirits animating them despise the living.

As the heroes emerge from the stairs into the barracks, the zombies become aware of them.

> There are five shambling, human corpses wandering amongst the beds. As one, the corpses turn as the heroes enter the barracks 
and start to advance.
 
*Intelligence (Religion)* +
«No Action» +
«Proficiency Required» +
DC 10 The corpses are zombies, the bodies of slain humanoids animated by dark spirits. They are compelled to grapple and devour the living. Even after they are brought down they tend to rise again and keep fighting. Fire or divine radiance are the best ways to destroy them.

*After defeating the zombies*

> There are two plain wooden trunks at the foot of each bed. A plain wooden door provides access to a walled-off room 
in the southwestern corner of the tower. There is a reinforced door in the exterior eastern wall. A flight of wooden stairs climbs up to the next floor.

include::{homedir}/npc_zombie_soldier.adoc[]

==== The Bloodstains
After defeating the zombies, when the heroes have time to look around the room, they might notice the dark, brown bloodstains Sir Arpaad left as he returned to this tower after the smith, Bartoz, mortally injured him.

*Wisdom (Perception)* +
«Passive» +
DC 15 Dark brown stains spatter the wooden floor near the heavy, eastern door. A similar brown smear stains the wall beside the door.If the heroes carefully examine the stains, they will recognize them as long dried bloodstains. There is not much blood, just a few spatters and a smeared stain on the wall.

*Intelligence (Investigation)* +
*Wisdom (Survival)* +
«Requires Proficiency» +
DC 10 There is not much blood on the floor. Just a few drops. It looks like an injured person used this door. It is impossible to tell whether they were coming or going. The smear on the wall is the right size and shape and at the right height for a hand print. Likely, hoever was hurt put a hand on the wall to steady themselves as they passed through the door.

==== The Trunks
There are twelve pinewood trunks in the room. Nine trunks have names scrawled across the top in charcoal. The remaining three have charcoal stains from old names smudged out years ago. The names are Kurz, Piri, Rast, Torval, Harl, Wren, Arno, Rykken, and Dolf, but do not share those names unless and until the players specifically ask.

[IMPORTANT]
The wooden dice cup and the exotic waterskin are valuable treasures. +
The healing potion. +
The ancient coins are described below. +
The other items are neither valuable nor important.

The contents of each soldiers’ trunks are as follows:

* Kurz Wool clothes.
* Rast Wool clothes, a purse with 5 cp and 1 sp.
* Torval Wool clothes, an engraved wooden dice cup with five ivory dice, a purse with 22 cp and 4 sp.
* Harl Wool clothes.
* Wren Wool clothes, a healing potion, a purse with 7 cp.
* Arno Wool clothes, a wolf claw totem whittled from pinewood, loose coins comprising 3 cp and 2 sp.
* Rykken Wool clothes, a waterskin made of pebbly gray skin and embossed with a hunting scene, a purse with 4 cp and 2 sp.
* Piri Piri’s trunk is nearly empty and contains only a spare, torn shirt, a woodcarver’s knife and a crudely whittled wooden flute that is half finished.
* Dolf Beneath his plain, woolen clothes, Dolf stuffed the heavy, furred cloak he took off Piri’s body. The cloak is recognizably similar to the ones hanging in C6 Gathering Hall and it has a large bloodstain inside it. At the bottom of the trunk, inside a glove, Dolf has hidden a handful of ancient coins.

==== The Ancient Coins
Dolf looted a dozen ancient coins from Berengar’s barrow. They are dull electrum; thin, worn, and tarnished. Heroes examining the coins might conclude:

*Intelligence (Smith’s Tools)*
«No Action» +
«Requires Proficiency» +
DC 10 The coins are made of beaten electrum. These days, that is an uncommon way of making coins in any realm. And the condition of the coins suggest they might be a few centuries old. A few of the coins are thinner than the rest and their stamps are cruder than the others.

*Intelligence (History)*
«No Action» +
«Requires Proficiency» +
DC 15 Most of the coins bear the mark of the ancient Helvetican Empire, which ruled most of the continent before its fall several hundred years ago. The other coins look just as old and look like the came from the unknown kingdoms of Atuaro.

==== Move On
The heroes can climb back down the stairs to C6 Gathering Hall. Or they can open the plain, wooden door and enter C8 Marshal Brask’s Room to the southeast. They can open the reinforced door to the east and cross C9 Covered Walk. Finally, they can climb the stairs up to C20 West Tower Landing on the west tower’s tower level.

=== Area 8 - Marshal Brask’s Room
This bedroom belonged to the Watch’s second-in-command, Marshal Ildo Brask. It is cramped with a single bed, a fireplace, a chair and small table that serves as a desk, and a stand for the Marshal’s armor. Marshal Brask was in the middle of writing a letter to Piri’s sister about her brother’s death when the Watch’s smith and supply master, Bartoz interrupted him. Bartoz told the Marshal that Sir Arpaad had lied about Brother Wulfram’s whereabouts and told him about the serpentine dagger the priest showed him. Brask took his sword belt and went to question Sir Arpaad.

[IMPORTANT]
The room is dark; the heroes need a light source to see. +
Detect Magic; there is magic present here.

> The room is a simple chamber with stone walls and a small bed. A fireplace provided a warm glow. On a wooden table, you see parchments, an ink jar, and a pen, along with a metal strongbox. In one corner, there's a stand with a suit of breastplate armor draped in a dark blue cloak.

* Detect Magic There is magic present. The cloak, a mantle of protection, radiates an aura of protective magic. The other aura cannot be pinpointed but comes from the magic weapon oil in the strongbox.

*Intelligence (History)* +
«No Action» +
«Requires Proficiency» +
DC 10 The title marshal originally referred to someone who managed a noble's stables and horses. Eventually referred to a military field commander. It is not technically an appropriate title for the Watch's second-in-command, but it sounds good and sometimes that is what really matters.

==== The Desk
Visible atop the desk are the following:

* Several sheets of blank parchment.
* The letter shown in Handout 1 Marshal Brask’s Letter.
* An ink pen discarded beside an open bottle of dried ink.
* A small pouch containing 12 cp, 14 sp, 1 gp, and a whittled wooden fox figurine.
* A half-burned tallow candle.

A hero examining the desk might conclude

*Intelligence (Investigation)* +
«No Action» +
«Requires Proficiency»
DC 10 The ink was left open to dry and the strongbox was left unlocked. Whoever was working here was interrupted. The chair is not toppled, and the candle was not left burning, so they did not jump up and rush out. They probably intended to return later, but it looks like they never did.

==== The Strongbox
An open metal strongbox, about half a cubic foot in size. 

> Brask’s metal strongbox is about six inches long and deep and sits open on the desk with a small key in the padlock. 

[IMPORTANT]
The moonstone is a valuable treasure. The magic weapon 
oil is described in Appendix B.

Marshal Brask’s strongbox contains the following:

* Loose coins amounting to 18 cp, 42 sp, and 9 gp.
* A polished, blue gemstone the size and shape of a robin’s egg. It is a moonstone.
* A sealed earthenware jar containing magic weapon oil. (See Extra)

==== The Armor
An armor stand in the corner displays the marshal’s breastplate armor. The armor is plain, but well maintained. There is a shimmering, dark blue cloak draped over the armor, a mantle of protection.

Heroes examining the armor might conclude the following:

*Intelligence (History)*
«No Action» +
«Requires Proficiency» +
DC 10 The clasp on the cloak’s chain appears to be a mark of rank. The owner was not a knight or a noble, but they were definitely an officer. Probably the garrison’s second-in-command serving under the Knight of the Watch.

*Intelligence (Investigation)*
«No Action» +
«Requires Proficiency» +
DC 15 The armor is well-taken care of, but it is also well worn. It is not ceremonial. Strangely, there is no weapon with the armor. Nor is there one hanging nearby. The mantle of protection is described below in Extra.

=== Area 9 - Covered Walk
A walk runs atop the wall that stretches across the road between the two towers. A wooden enclosure and roof have been built over the walk. It is called a hoarding. Small, triangular windows along the hoarding called loopholes allowed archers to fire down on their foes. A number of small pits in the floor open into the neck below where the road runs through the wall. These murder holes allowed guards to drop stones or heated sand on foes trapped between the gates.

Unfortunately, a flock of bloodsucking stirges now live here and they will attack the heroes once they make their way about halfway down the walk, unless the heroes notice them first. These same stirges killed the peddler whose body the heroes found earlier. 
After dealing with the flock, the heroes might note the stirges’ nests in the rafters.

[IMPORTANT]
The room is dimly lit, daylight streams in through the archers’ loopholes. +
The heroes can fall through the murder holes!

> A flagstone walkway runs atop the wall like a bridge between the two towers. A wooden enclosure — a hoarding — covers the walkway. These Triangular windows — loopholes — permit archers to fire down on the road. A grid of small pits in the floor — murder holes — allow guards to attack foes trapped between the gates below.

DC 15 Hidden in what looks like nesting material amongst the rafters that hold up the room are a half-dozen shadowy, insectoid shapes. They remain very still, waiting to ambush the party.

DC 10 Reveal that the insects are bloodsucking stirges. They use their barbed claws to attach to their prey and then drink their blood through their proboscises. A small flock of stirges can completely drain an adult human of blood.

==== The Stirges
The six stirges are intent on feeding, but they will not die for their meals. Once a stirge has been injured, it will withdraw and try to escape through one of the loopholes. After half the flock has died or fled, the remaining stirges will withdraw and try to flee.

> A flock of creatures takes wing and attacks. A half-dozen foot-long insects with leathery bat wings, barbed legs, and long needle-like noses come flapping down from their dirty nests in the rafters to attack...

*Attach.* +
Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 1 piercing damage, +
and the stirge attaches itself to the target. The stirge can detach itself at any time and detaches itself when the creature dies. Attached stirges move with the creature to which they are attached. A creature can remove one stirge that’s attached to itself 
or another adjacent creature as an action on its turn.

*Feed.* +
The stirge drains blood from the target to which it is attached. The target loses 4 (1d4+2) hit points due to blood loss. When a stirge has drained a 10 hit points worth of blood from a target, it detaches itself and attempts to fly away to digest its meal.

==== The Nests in the Rafters
The stirges have made nests in the beams holding the roof up. The nests are made of dried twigs, leaves, pine needles, mud, and bits of debris. 

Alert heroes might notice:

*Wisdom (Perception)* +
«Passive» +
DC 15 Amongst the twigs, mud, and debris of one of the stirge nests, there are metallic gleams in the nest. The beams are ten feet above the floor. A hero can make a vertical jump and grab the beams and then pull themselves up. Or the hero might climb a rope into the beams.

*Strength (Athletics)* +
DC 15 to make a standing jump and catch hold of the rafters overhead. +
DC 20 to pull oneself onto the rafter.

In the nest there are multiple gold (2d10), silver (2d20), and copper (1d100) coins.

If the heroes come up with another plan, assess it and use ability checks to resolve it. Most attempts to get up into the rafters should be made at DC 15 or DC 20. If the heroes pool their efforts and help each other, grant them advantage.

==== Move On
When the heroes are ready to move on, they open the heavy door at the eastern end of walk and enter C10 East Tower Landing. Otherwise, they can return to the western tower and C7 Barracks through the western door.

=== Area 10 - East Tower Landing [Upperlevel]
Sir Einrik Arpaad passed through this empty, unfurnished room after he was mortally wounded by Bartoz the smith in the workshop. The heroes might notice the bloodstains he left as they pass through here.

[IMPORTANT]
The room is dark; the heroes need a light source to see. +
Dark brown stains spatter the wooden floor near the top of the stairs

> The room landing is unfurnished and empty. There are plain wooden doors in the southern and eastern interior walls that divide this floor of the tower. A flight of wooden stairs climbs down to the level below. A wooden ladder bolted to the wall of an alcove climbs to a heavy trap door in the ceiling.

 Wisdom (Perception) «Passive» DC 15 

==== The Bloodstains
If the heroes carefully examine the stains, they will recognize them as long dried bloodstains. There is not much blood, just a few spatters on the floor at the top of the stairs.

*Intelligence (Investigation)* +
*Wisdom (Survival)* +
«Requires Proficiency» 
DC 10 There is not much blood on the floor or the stairs. Just a few drops. It looks like an injured person climbed this stair, though it is impossible to say whether they were ascending or descending.

==== Move On
Once the heroes have finished here, they can enter C11 Brother Wulfram’s Room through the plain, wooden door to the south or C13 Chapel through the plain door to the east. They can ascend the ladder and open the heavy, iron-banded trap door to reach C14 East Tower Crown. They can descend the wooden steps to C15 Common Room. Or they can return through the reinforced door in the exterior wall to the west to C9 Covered Walk.

=== Area 11 - Brother Wulfram’s Room
The bed in this small bedchamber is covered with heavy wool blankets and the cold fireplace is heaped with ash. The room belonged to the Watch’s elderly chaplain, Brother Wulfram. After Sir Arpaad killed the priest in his study, the knight dragged Wulfram’s body in here and stuffed it in the trunk at the foot of his bed. He then stole the key. The heroes will definitely notice the smell and likely see the bloodstain on the floor. If they manage to open Wulfram’s trunk, they will find the body.

[IMPORTANT]
The room is dark; the heroes need a light source to see. +
The body of Brother Wulfram's body is in the wooden trunk +
Bloodstains on the floor Perception DC 15

> The air is pervaded by a thick, rotting stench. The bedroom contains a bed piled with warm blankets, a small washstand, and a fireplace. At the foot of the bed is a padlocked, wooden trunk. There are plain, wooden doors in the northern and eastern interior walls of the tower.

==== The Bloodstain
> The dark, brown stain on the wooden floorboards is unmistakably a dried bloodstain. The smearing obviously indicates that something heavy and bloody was dragged across the floor into or out of the eastern door.

*Wisdom (Perception)* +
«Passive» +
DC 15 There are brown stains smeared on the wooden floor by the eastern door.

==== The Trunk
The wood-and-iron trunk is closed with an iron padlock. The heroes can try to break the lock if they have a crowbar or a similar tool or they can pick it. Or they can unlock it with the key found in C23 Sir Arpaad’s Study. The party can also destroy the chest itself with an axe or similar tool but doing so makes it harder to glean information from Wulfram’s body.

==== The Body
After Arpaad broke Wulfram’s skull with the statuette in C12 Brother Wulfram’s Study, he hid Wulfram’s body in this trunk where it has been rotting slowly for a few months. The body is in an advanced state of decay, the flesh putrefied and waxy. The smell is horrendous. The party will have to remove the body to examine it.

*Wisdom (Medicine)* +
«Requires Proficiency» +
«Disadvantage: A Hero Destroyed the Chest» +
DC 15 Reveal the remains are of a frail or elderly human. The body has slowly been rotting away stuffed inside the chest. The hattered skull indicates the human took a heavy blow to the head. 

Any examination also turns up the priest’s holy symbol, three linked silver rings contained in a ring of gold.

*Intelligence (Religion)*
«No Action»
DC 5 Reveal that the body wears a holy symbol of Ohm, the Shining Lord of the Heavens and the champion of light, justice, and civilization. The three smaller rings represent his three sainted knights.

==== Move On
When the heroes are ready to depart, they can use the plain wooden door to the east to enter C12 Brother Wulfram’s Study or the plain door in the northern wall to return to C10 East Tower Landing.

==== Extra
Putrefaction — the liquification of a human body — generally starts bout a month after death, but can take longer depending on where the body is. As a GM, always remember to delete your search history when using a public computer.
