== Druid (Cornus)
        
*Cornus's Quest: The Liberation of the Shadowed Arena* +
You learn of a disturbing underground operation where rats are forced to fight against specifically trained dogs for entertainment. Driven by his compassion for nature and a desire to protect the vulnerable, Cornus decides to undertake a quest to break up the dogfighting ring and free the exploited creatures.

=== Objectives:

*Gathering Information:* +
Cornus investigates rumors and gathers information about the location and key figures involved in the illegal dogfighting ring. This may involve questioning locals, interacting with the criminal underworld, or observing suspicious activities.

*Infiltrating the Arena:* +
Cornus plans and executes a strategy to infiltrate the shadowed arena where the fights take place. This requires stealth, cunning, and an understanding of the layout of the underground operation.

*Animal Rescue:* +
Once inside the arena, Cornus focuses on freeing the captive rats and dogs. This involves overcoming guards, disabling traps, and ensuring the safety of the animals without alerting the organizers.

*Confronting the Organizers:* +
Cornus identifies the masterminds behind the dogfighting ring and confronts them. This may involve negotiation, intimidation, or even a physical confrontation to put an end to their cruel practices.

*Animal Sanctuary Establishment:* +
Cornus works to establish a safe haven or sanctuary for the rescued animals. This could involve seeking assistance from local animal shelters, sympathetic individuals, or even using his druidic abilities to create a natural haven for the creatures.

=== Challenges:

*Undercover Dangers:* +
Cornus faces the risk of being discovered as he infiltrates the arena. He must disguise himself or find alternative means to move undetected.

*Guardian Beasts:* +
The organizers deploy trained animals as guardians within the arena. Cornus must find non-lethal methods to incapacitate these creatures while ensuring the safety of the rats and dogs.

*Moral Dilemmas:* +
Cornus encounters individuals who are complicit in the dogfighting ring but may be coerced or struggling with their involvement. He must navigate moral dilemmas and potentially offer them a chance at redemption.

=== Outcome:

*Success:* +
Cornus successfully dismantles the dogfighting ring, liberates the animals, and establishes a sanctuary for their rehabilitation. The organizers face justice, and the community becomes more aware of the cruelty associated with such activities.

*Partial Success:* +
Cornus manages to free some of the animals and disrupt the dogfighting ring, but some challenges remain unresolved. The quest becomes a catalyst for ongoing efforts to combat illegal animal fighting in the region.

*Failure:* +
Cornus faces setbacks, and the dogfighting ring persists. However, the quest serves as a motivation for him to continue the fight against animal cruelty, potentially leading to future opportunities for redemption and success.
