== Rogue/Thief (Antonio)

=== Downtime Activity:
Antonio is caught attempting to steal from a renowned, benevolent figure in the town. Instead of punishing him, the figure offers Antonio a chance at redemption. The figure introduces him to a skilled mentor who teaches him the value of using his stealth for good â€“ perhaps training him as a spy or investigator. +
=> mentor is magnifico the magnificent

=== Challenge
*The Illusionary Heist with a Moral Twist* +
Magnifico creates an illusionary scenario in which Antonio must navigate through a simulated high-security environment to "steal" a valuable artifact. However, this time, the challenge has a moral twist.

=== Objective:
        
Antonio's task is not only to successfully navigate through the illusionary heist but to discern between innocent targets and corrupt individuals, focusing his "theft" on the corrupt and avoiding harm to the innocent. +
Lessons:

*Discerning Morality:* +
Antonio learns to discern between innocent bystanders and corrupt individuals within the illusionary scenario. Magnifico emphasizes the importance of choosing targets wisely.

*Non-lethal Approaches:* +
Antonio is encouraged to utilize non-lethal means and creative tactics to neutralize threats and complete the heist without causing harm to innocent NPCs.

*Redistributing Wealth:* +
After the heist, Magnifico discusses the moral implications of the targets Antonio chose. The challenge reinforces the concept of stealing from the corrupt to benefit the greater good, aligning with the Robin Hood ethos.

=== Outcome:

*Success:* +
If Antonio successfully completes the illusionary heist without harming innocent bystanders and targets the corrupt, Magnifico commends his moral choices, imparting the lesson that thieving can be a force for justice.

*Failure:* +
If Antonio inadvertently harms innocent NPCs or targets the wrong individuals, Magnifico uses the experience to emphasize the importance of discernment and the potential harm caused by recklessness in the pursuit of justice.

This modified challenge not only tests Antonio's thieving skills but also guides him toward a more morally conscious approach, aligning with the ideals of Robin Hood by encouraging him to use his skills to address injustice without causing harm to the innocent.
