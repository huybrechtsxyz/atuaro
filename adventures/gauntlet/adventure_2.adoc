== The Silverspine Roads

=== Introduction
After returning the girl Bess to her village our rat catchers are hailed as heroes. The merchant they saved proposes they protect the cargo to Loukotokia and to the Gundren's estate there. They will pass the Silverpine Watch gate where everthing is not as it should. If they solve the problems of the watch, they will arrive at the Gundren's estate. From which you can continue to the next adventure.

=== On the road again
Afterwards they meet with Gudrun in the Stonehill Inn who offers them a job guarding Gudrun back to town. If the players ask about what sort of dangers they might face or if there is anything specific the merchant is worried about:

> Traveling is becoming more dangerous by the day. Even on the kings roads. No one travels without a weapon and no one travels alone if they can afford not to. Some lords try to keep the roads clear. There are watchtowers and fortresses protecting important routes. But bandits and robbers are a constant threat. There is an influx in dangerous monsters attacking travelers as well.

*About Gundren* +
As DM keep track of Gundren's disposition towards the party. Gundren is so far really fond of the adventurers as they saved him. But that does not mean he has to keep liking the heroes. During the adventure, the heroes might do things to sour his opinion of them. Adjust your portrayal of Gundren to match his opinion of the heroes. He will not sabotage the heroes, but he will act impatient, short-tempered, brusque, grumpy, or even with-hold information from them.

*About the money.* +
Gudrun is offering each hero 5 gold pieces for seeing them safely to the city of Loukotokia. 

* This is good pay for a group of inexperienced adventurers staying fairly close to civilized lands. Most commoners earn about a silver piece a day and, given the length of the trip, Gudrun is paying the heroes about five times that.
* If the players decide that is not enough and want to try for a better deal, which players will sometimes do on principle, he will increase the pay to 6 gold pieces “and not a copper more.” The negotiation will diminish Gudrun's disposition toward the party.

*Making Travel Preparations.* +
Point out that each hero has a ten-day supply of trail rations and a waterskin they can refill from the many springs, creeks, and ponds they will pass.

*About the Goods.* +
Gudrun has a haphazard mix of goods in his cart. He has some bolts of wool and canvas, a few pots and pans, some casks of mead and wine, cut wooden staves, a few iron ingots, a few inexpensive trinkets, and mining equipment. As it is early spring, there is no fruit or vegetables, but there are a few sacks of rye, some pickled fish in a barrel, and some salted pork. It is exactly the sort of stuff a peddler like her would have in his cart. This was bought in the towns general store.

> You are gathered on the townsquare. It is just after dawn; the weather is gloomy. The merchant is getting his cart ready. The dwarf’s cart is half-full of bundles, barrels, crates, and sacks. Two shaggy, miniature horses are harnessed to the cart already. One is solid gray while the other has dark spots over a light coat: Dapple and Mist. He hops up onto the bench at the front of the cart and snaps the reigns and spurs Dapple and Mist, her horses, to a walk. The cart trundles through the gate.

=== The Forest Road

image::{homedir}/assets/maps/silverpine_2_road_combat_custom.png[align=center]

> Silverpine Forest is a heavy, mixed-growth forest covering the Aster river valley and the foothills of upper Asternia north-west of Loukotokia. In the lowlands, the forest is thick with broadleaf trees like willows, alders, poplars, and oaks interspersed with evergreen spruces and the whitebark pines from which the forest gets its name. In the uplands, where most of this part of the adventure takes place, the terrain consists of rough, forested hills. There are fewer shrubs and ground cover here, fewer broadleaf trees, and more evergreens.

> It is springtime. The evergreen trees are bare or budding. The road is muddy from rain and snow melt. The party passes streams and rivulets frequently. The forest’s natural fauna is active, but skittish and Gundren's cart is noisy. The party might see robins, sparrows, or finch-es in the trees or hear a woodpecker tapping away. They might startle a rabbit or pheasant or catch sight of a red deer darting away between the trees. At night, they might hear the cries of owls or night thrushes or the distant howls of wolves.

> The Silverpine Road is a narrow, dirt track. In a few places, there are just a pair of furrows left by the passage of countless carts in the weeds. The road winds back and forth, following the contours of the land. In the uplands, it climbs gradually upward, winding between steep hills, sometimes following steep bluffs or sheer, bare rock faces.

> It has been two days since you left Kainga. It is a mid-spring morning and the sky is gray. The weather is breezy and chilly as it is early spring. The narrow dirt road winds back and forth between rolling, forested hills. Gundren is driving Mist and Dapple at a comfortable pace. Gundren is sociable, easy to laugh, and good at small-talk. He talks about finding the fabled Echo caves. In fact it is really only what he talks about. He knows all the stories.

*About the Echo Caves* +
More than five hundred years ago, clans of dwarves and gnomes made an agreement known as the Phandelver's Pact, by which they would share a rich mine in a wondrous cavern known as Wave Echo Cave. The mine had great deposits of mineral wealth. Times were good, and the nearby human town of Phandalin (pronounced fan-duh-lin) prospered as well. But then disaster struck when orcs swept through the North and laid waste to all in their path and the location of Wave Echo Cave was lost. For centuries, rumors of buried riches have attracted treasure seekers and opportunists to the area around Phandalin, but no one has ever succeeded in locating the lost mine.

=== The Accident
> The road is a dirt track overgrown with weeds here. It is about 10 feet wide. Scattered trees by the roadside can provide cover. Thick underbrush grows between the trees which constitutes difficult terrain.

> It is mid-afternoon. The weather is gray and chilly and the road muddy. Gundren is driving Mist and Dapple at a comfortable walking pace and keeps talking about Echo Cave. When you round a bend in the road Dapple and Mist suddenly give a frightened whinnies and rear up. The cart lurches as the veer sharply for the side of the road. The cart suddenly stops when its wheel becomes stuck in a muddy rut at the side of the road. Dapple and Mist scream and struggle against the cart. Gundren were thrown of the cart and strikes his head and falls unconscious. 

*When the horses are calm, Gundren is stable or conscious, and the cart is free, the encounter is over.* +
Based on the travel order, decide which way the cart lurches such that it threatens to strike at least one hero. It is most likely to strike heroes walking alongside it, but if there is no one beside the cart, it hits a hero ahead of it. 

Both the unconscious halfling and the panicked horses are emergencies. The heroes should not ignore them. If the heroes seem unsure of what to do, if they are slow to act, or if they ignore either problem, describe how the horse’s struggles are damaging the cart or how Gundren is not moving and she is getting paler by the moment.

TIP: [small]#After you call for action, wait for one of the players to describe their hero’s action. Do not resolve the action right away. Instead, repeat it to the party. Then ask the other players what they would like to do at the same time. “Alice’s character is tending to Gundren. Bob, does your character do something while she’s doing that?” Note what each hero is doing. Once everyone is doing something, or they have declined to take action, resolve each player’s action in turn. Then, ask for a new round of actions.#

==== Call for action

* _EMERGENCY_: Avoid being struck
* _EMERGENCY_: Gundren is laying motionless in the road. Blood is pooling around her head. She might have a serious injury and will need help quickly.
* _EMERGENCY_: Dapple and Mist are struggling against their harnesses; the cart is creaking and groaning. If they are not calmed quickly, they might break the harnesses or hurt themselves.
* The snake? There is no obvious sign of anything that might have panicked the horses.
* The cart’s wheel is stuck in a muddy rut at the edge of the road. Until it is freed, there is no going anywhere.

==== Avoid being struck
*DC of 11*

* Gundren and any hero riding on the cart are thrown off
* Any hero riding on the cart is thrown from the cart as well.

Heroes struck can dodge the cart Dexterity Saving Throw DC 11. +
Failure: The hero is clipped by the cart and takes 1d4 bludgeoning damage.

==== The Snake
A common adder was basking in the road. The heroes overlooked it due to its camouflage and the horses nearly stepped on it. The snake is afraid of the party and easily driven off, so it will not attack unless a hero gets too close without seeing it and startles it. Then the snake will strike before slithering away. The snake is not a dangerous combatant, they can kill the snake without issue.

* *Wisdom (Perception)* «Passive» DC of 18 The hero spots the motionless, gray-and-brown snake in the road.
* *Intelligence (Nature)* «No Action» DC of 12 The snake is a common adder. The snake is two feet long, two inches thick. It’s pebbly skin is mottled gray and brown. It was probably just trying to warm itself when the horses nearly stepped on. The snake is venomous, but not deadly to humanoids.

TIP: Grant rangers or druids advantage on the check to identify it.

If a hero examines the wound from the snake’s bite, they can determine the following: Wisdom (Medicine) «Requires Proficiency» DC 11 the bite is swollen and painful, but not life threatening. The swelling should go down soon, and the bitten hero will not suffer any long-term effects.

include::{rootdir}/statblocks/snake_poisonous.adoc[]

==== Calming the horses
Dapple and Mist are panicking. Their struggles threaten to break their harness, damage the cart, or injure them. If the heroes ignore the horses, describe the creaks and groans coming from the cart. Make it seem like an emergency.

If Gundren is conscious, he can calm Dapple and Mist automatically. No ability check is needed.

* *Wisdom (Animal Handling)* +
«Advantage: offering the horses an apple or other food» +
«Disadvantage: The Snake has not Been Driven Off» +
DC 10 Dapple and Mist stop struggling and calm down. +
Failure The horses continue to thrash and struggle.

Each time the heroes fail describe the increased strain on the harness or cart. After 3 failed attempts they brake the equipment and escape in the forest. Easy Skill Challenge: 4 Successes over 3 failures allowed.

====
Objective:

    This represents their efforts in finding and calming down their horses in the forest.
    Success: they lose a few hours but can continue their journey.
    Failure: they lose the horses and must leave the cart.

Rules:

    The heroes can't use the same skill twice in a row.
    The heroes can't use the same skill that another hero has just used.
    The heroes need to accumulate 4 Successes over 3 failures allowed.

Sample Skill Checks:

==== Tending to Gundren
If a hero goes to tend to Gundren wounds
> Gundren struck his head as he fell from the cart. He is unconscious and bleeding from a cut on his head. 

* *Wisdom (Medicine)* +
«Automatic Success: Healer’s Kit» +
DC 10 and Gundren is stabilized and stops bleeding and no longer makes death saving throws. +
Stabilizing Gundren does not return her to consciousness! Throw a 1d4 to see when Gundren regains consciousness.

Once one of the heroes has checked on Gundren, roll a d20 where the players cannot see the result, make a grim face, and make a note on your scratch paper. Gundren is making death saving throws. Make another one each time the party takes a round of actions. After Gundren makes five death saving throws, he dies.

Do not actually keep track of the results, though. Since this is a tutorial encounter, Gundren cannot actually die. After you have made a death saving throw for Gundren, Keep track of how many saving throws you have made. 

==== Searching the Cart
It might occur to the heroes to root through Gundren's cart and look for something to help them deal with the situation.

*Wisdom (Perception) DC 10* +
The hero turns up either a small bag of lumpy green horse apples or a healer’s kit. Determine which randomly unless the hero specified they were looking for medical supplies or feed for the horses. A second search will yield the other item if successful.

The heroes can keep the healer’s kit. If the heroes ask Gundren about it, she will gladly let them have it. +
But, make a note if the party keeps the kit without mentioning it to Gundren.

==== Freeing the Cart
The cart’s wheel is stuck in a muddy ditch at the side of the road. One or more of the heroes can push the cart free:

*Strength* +
«Advantage: Multiple Heroes Work Together» +
«Disadvantage: The Horses Are Still Panicked» DC 20 +
The cart’s wheel is freed from the muddy rut. If the horses are calm, they can pull the cart free:

*Charisma (Handle Animal)* +
«Advantage: Offered Horse Apple or Similar Food» DC 10 The horse’s pull the cart free of the muddy rut.

==== Move On
*When the horses are calm, Gundren is stable or conscious, and the cart is free, the encounter is over.* +
If Gundren is conscious, he suggests the party rest for an hour. +
If the party does not rest, note of who is driving the cart if Gundren is unconscious.

=== A Short Rest
*Optional*

After being thrown from the cart, Gundren is either unconscious or shaken and several of the heroes might be hurt. 

* If a hero was bitten by the snake, remind them about the painful, swollen wound.
* If a hero was thrown from or struck by the cart, remind them of their bumps and bruises.
* Remind the party of Gundren status; is she fully healed, conscious, or unconscious.
* The horses are browsing in the roadside brush; they look around nervously?

*Nervous Horses*
The horses are still shaken from their panic, but they are also aware of the pack of feral dogs stalking through the un-derbrush nearby. As you set the scene and describe the short rest, mention their nervousness a couple of times in pass-ing. Subtle repetition of important details is a helpful way of foreshadowing current events.If a hero tries to soothe the horses, resolve the action with an ability check. If the players decide to look around, skip the short rest and move on to B5 Feral Dogs.

*Short Rest*

====
A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading, and tending to wounds.

A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of a short rest, up to the character’s maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal to the character’s level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls the die and adds the character’s Constitution modifier to it. The character regains hit points equal to the total. The player can decide to spend an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.

Player’s Handbook, pg. 186 
====

If Gundren is conscious, interact with the heroes and try to start a conversation while everyone is resting. If no one wants to talk, stretch out the rest with some narration. Describe the forest scene, describe the characters tending their wounds or eating rations, the horses being nervous, that sort of thing.

*Move On* +
After the party completes the short rest, Gundren climbs into the back of the cart to check her goods before the party resumes their travels. The heroes take up their positions in the travel order. If the party claimed the healer’s kit in The Accident,  he notices that it is gone. He does not say anything, but her disposition toward the party is diminished. After checking her goods, Gundren climbs onto the cart’s bench and snaps the reigns, but Dapple and Mist just whinny nervously.

TIP: There is an art to foreshadowing. If you want the players to notice something, say it thrice +
Ask for perception roles or if the players want to check out why the horses are nervous?

=== Feral Dogs

> Dapple and Mist keep acting nervous while Gundren tries to get them moving. A calculated rustling among the underbrush reveals the approach of three feral dogs, they are large, but skinny, mangy, and scarred. Their predatory instincts honed to exploit any vulnerabilities. With uncanny precision, the dogs position themselves with caution, flanking the adventurers and preparing for an ambush. Suddenly the dogs spring forth, their movements swift and coordinated, lunging towards their prey with fierce determination.

==== Call to Action
* The feral dogs are starving, mad, attack immediately and will fight to the death. The dogs emerge onto the road 30 feet ahead of the heroes.
* Gundren keeps the horses under control. If Gundren is unconscious, some-one else will have to keep the horses from panicking again. Gundren uses his turn in combat to keep Dapple and Mist from panicking.
* Remind the players that Gundren is either on the cart’s bench or unconscious in the cart
* The dogs are no longer domesticated; they have gone feral. They are starving, and they attack immediately. They are not likely to respond to attempts to calm them. However, if one of the players comes up with a clever plan to calm the dogs or drive them off, resolve it using your own best judgment. The feral dogs focus all their attention on the heroes. Unless the heroes ignore them completely, they will not go after Gundren or the horses.

==== Encounter

*Intelligence (Nature)* +
«No Action» «Proficiency Required» +
DC 10 The dogs look like hunting dogs gone feral. +
Their master must have died or abandoned them, and they have been struggling to survive in the wild. They are not powerful, but they’re desperate enough to attack the party. 

include::{rootdir}/statblocks/dog_feral.adoc[]

==== The Horses
The feral dogs frighten Gundren’s horses, Dapple and Mist. Someone must keep Dapple and Mist under control, or else the horses will bolt.If no one tries to keep the horses under control or the at-tempt to control them fails, the horses panic. When the horses panic, describe their attempts to break free and run as you did in The Accident. Make it seem like the harnesses are going to break any moment, or the horses are going to bolt, or one of the horses is going to get hurt. Make it seem urgent. But do not actually have anything happen unless you want to.If Gundren is conscious, he uses her action each turn to control the horses. No ability check is needed.

If Gundren is unconscious, any hero can use an action on their turn to keep the horses from panicking that round:

*Charisma (Handle Animal)* +
DC 10 The horses are kept from panicking for one round. +
Failure: The horses panic.If the players are ignoring the horses and you feel up to im-provising, have the horses bolt, trampling the heroes and the dogs on the road ahead. +
Use Dexterity saving throws to see who can dodge out of the way and apply appropriate damage to anyone who does not. If one of the heroes gives chase, they can catch up to the cart. +
Use ability checks to see if they can jump onto the cart and regain control as appropriate. If the heroes do not catch the cart themselves, Dapple and Mist eventually calm down and come to a stop further up the road.

==== Move On
Once the last dog is dead or driven off, silence falls over the road. Although it is only mid-afternoon, the shadow of the forest hangs over the road. A frustrated Gundren suggests that the party just make camp for the night and start fresh in the morning and he will brook no argument this time. When the party is ready to rest for the night.

=== Making Camp
> "It is late afternoon, people" says Gundren. "Time to make camp. After dealing with everything today; accidents, injuries, and feral dogs; I would say I need to get a good night’s rest. Wasn't anybody bitten by a snake? I had it, lets look for a good place to camp."

The terrain makes it impossible to move the cart and the horses off the road. You are forced to make their camp at the side of the road as you have done for the last several nights of travel. If the players seem engaged, ask them what sort of activities their heroes are getting up to. 

* Firewood, food and water
* Who tends to the horses
* Setup a night watch?

> While you are setting around the campfire, Gundren casually mentions that the party will probably pass through Silverpine Watch sometime the next day. Silverpine Watch is a gatehouse that protects the road.

If the players ask about the watch (If they are feeling talkative, play it out. Otherwise, just narrate the information):

* Gundren's route goes through this watch a few times a year, and he has met the Watch’s commander, a knight named Sir Arpaad. He respects him as fair, just, and honest, but also does not like him very much. He is probably a good knight, in his estimation, but he is not very friendly.
* Gundren does like Bartoz. He is built like a bear, he says, but he is friendly and helpful. He runs the Watch’s forge and keeps their supplies. In years past, he and Gundren have exchanged goods and, last year, he repaired his cart’s har-ness for free.
* Gundren does not know any of the dozen soldiers by name; he never stays long at Silverpine Watch. He just pays his toll tax and continues on her way. 

> The next day dawns chilly and gray. You wakes up and breaks down the camp. Gundren harnesses Dapple and Mist, checks his goods, and then resumes her position on the cart’s bench. The rest of the heroes take up their positions *in the travel order. -ASK-* spurs Dapple and Mist to a walk and the party is underway again.

=== The Tinkers Body
> It is morning; the weather is gloomy and chilly. The forest is rugged and hilly as the cart passes around the bends of a sheer, rocky hillside. Gundren calls out to a lumpy furry mass in the road fifty feet in front of them. A human body in a furred cloak. Gundren reins Dapple and Mist to a stop.

If none of the heroes act, Gundren will tell whoever is in the lead to check out the body. Otherwise, Gundren will leave the heroes to investigate the scene and wait until they are done. He also does not want to leave the body in the road. If the party refuses to investigate or bury the body, Gundren disposition toward the party is diminished. He will not travel with the body. He does not want to be haunted by an angry spirit.

==== Approaching the body
From a distance, the party can only confirm that the mass in the road looks like a human body lying face down beneath a thick, fur-covered traveling cloak. As they approach, the heroes might note the following:

*Intelligence (Nature)* +
«No Action» «Requires Proficiency» +
DC 10 It is odd that the body has not attracted scavenging beasts or carrion birds.

*Intelligence (Religion)* +
«No Action» «Requires Proficiency» +
DC 10 An unburied, abandoned body can be dangerous. If sentient beings are not laid to rest properly, their bodies or spirits can rise as undead monsters. Especially if they died in a sudden or traumatic way. +

*Wisdom (Perception)* +
«Passive» +
DC 15 The character notices the tinker’s tracks in the road as described below. Gundren’s superstitions or their own conclusions might make the heroes nervous. As such, they might want to take precautions as they approach the body. Let them do so, but take note of anything the heroes do to damage the body as they approach, such as peppering it with arrows or launching spells at it. If the heroes damage the body, it will make their investigation more difficult.

==== The Body
> The tinker’s body is currently lying face down in the road. It is wearing a torn, furred cloak over drab, travelers’ clothes.

The party cannot determine anything more without turning over the body and making a careful examination. Once a hero turns over and inspects the body, they notice that

> The corpse’s skin is unnaturally pale and grayish white. They do not see any signs of injury.

Heroes who inspect or examine the body might also note the following:

*Intelligence (Investigation)* +
«Requires Proficiency» +
DC 10 Though his cloak and clothes are ripped, there is no blood staining them. Or on the ground around him. +
DC 15 Based on his clothing and that he is not armed or armored, he is a traveler not a soldier. He is at least five days from town. He should have some traveling supplies. He does not even seem to have a backpack.

*Wisdom (Medicine)* +
«Requires Proficiency» +
DC 10 His oddly pale skin, the lack of blood on his clothes, and the lack of bruising suggests the man’s body has been completely drained of blood. DC 15: He has a half-dozen puncture wounds in his back, shoulders, and legs. They are difficult to spot because of the lack of swelling or discoloration.

*Wisdom (Perception)* +
«Advantage: Specify Searching for Wounds or Cause of Death» +
DC 15 The body has a half-dozen puncture wounds in his back, shoulders, and legs. They are difficult to spot because of the lack of swelling, discoloration, or bleeding.

==== The Trail
The heroes might notice the signs of the tinker’s passage in the road, might turn them up with a search of the road around the body, or they might specifically search for tracks and signs of passage. If they do so, they might discover the following:

*Wisdom (Perception)* +
«Passive» +
DC 15 There are scuff marks and disturbed weeds in the road near the body, marking the man’s passage.

*Wisdom (Survival)* +
«Requires Proficiency» +
«Advantage: Signs of Passage Already Noticed» +
DC 10 From the signs in the road, it looks like the man was coming from further up the road. Probably within the last day.
DC 15 It looks like the man was running all out, but was stumbling and off balance. The hero can follow the man’s trail up the road

==== Up the Road
If the heroes move fifty feet up the road from the body, possibly while following the tinker’s trail, they might notice the following clues that will lead them to the tinker’s discarded backpack:

*Wisdom (Perception)* +
«Passive» +
DC 15 The undergrowth off the road’s left side looks like it has been disturbed by something passing through it.

*Wisdom (Survival)* +
«Requires Proficiency» +
«Requires Already Following the Tinker’s Trail» +
«No Action» +
DC 15 It looks like the man was running from further up the road but had some kind of struggle here. He staggered and stumbled and then lurched toward the left side of the road before he running to where he fell.

*Detect Magic* +
There is a magical presence, but it cannot be pinpointed. It is coming from the healing potion in the man’s backpack.If a hero approaches the left edge of the road, they will spot the man’s backpack in the brush without issue.

==== The Backpack
The tinker’s backpack lies in the brush where he threw it. The leather backpack is scratched and has several surface tears. A hero handling it, or one standing nearby, might note the following:

*Intelligence (Investigation)* +
«No Action» +
«Requires Proficiency» +
DC 10 It looks like something with lots of small claws or burrs got caught on the backpack and was then torn free. The tinker’s discarded, leather backpack contains: +
» A week’s worth of trail rations, a waterskin, and normal traveling supplies +
» Scraps of tin, a set of tinker’s tools, and a whetstone for sharpening blades +
» A small, polished brass candlestick that looks valuable +
» A glass vial containing a paler shade of red sticky liquid (healing potion).

The brass candlestick is a valuable treasure. Tell the party that its common knowledge among adventurers that the sweet, pale red liquid in the vial is a healing potion. 

==== Burying the Body
The heroes can bury the body in the forest off the road or raise a cairn of rocks over it. Gundren can lend the party a shovel and a woodcutter’s axe from her cart. It takes an hour of work, during which the party is not disturbed. A character with proficiency in the Religion skill can perform proper burial rites.

There are no specific consequences for not burying the body unless you want to invent some. Gundren’s superstitious fear of the body and the information about bodies sometimes rising as undead help to set up the party’s later encounters with the undead in Silverpine Watch. 

==== Moving On
Once the heroes are finished with their investigation and the body has been dealt with, the party resumes their travel order and Gundren climbs back on the cart. Uneasily, Gundren gives a half-hearted snap of the reins and travel resumes.
