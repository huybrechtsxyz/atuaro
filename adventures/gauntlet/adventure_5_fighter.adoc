== Fighter (Mario)
Mario decides to open a self-defense workshop for those who have been bullied. He shares his experiences and teaches others how to stand up for themselves. This activity not only helps Mario come to terms with his own past but also empowers others in the community.

=== Encounter: The Alleyway Ambush
A dimly lit alley in the local district. Mario encounters one of his classmates, a young man named Alex, who is cornered by a small local gang of five commoners.

*Gang Members:*

    Ringleader Charles (Human): Wields a crude club and has an air of false bravado.
    Bully 'Herman' (Half-Orc): Physically imposing and aggressive.
    Schemer 'Andre' (Halfling): Nimble and quick-witted, armed with a small blade.
    Bravado 'Brave' (Half-Elf): Overconfident and flashy, dual-wielding makeshift weapons.
    Bully's Friend 'Steve' (Dwarf): Gruff and intimidating, but slightly hesitant.

=== Encounter Scenario:

    As Mario approaches the alley, he sees Alex surrounded by the gang members, who are demanding money or valuables.
    The gang spots Mario and becomes hostile, escalating the situation. The ringleader taunts Mario, challenging him to a fight.
    Mario must now engage in combat to protect Alex and teach the gang members a lesson.

*Key Features:*

* Tight Spaces: The alleyway limits maneuverability, potentially providing advantages and disadvantages based on positioning.
* Improvised Weapons: The gang members use makeshift weapons like clubs, blades, and broken bottles, making the encounter more dynamic and unpredictable.
* Verbal Taunts: The gang members may attempt to distract and demoralize Mario with verbal taunts, potentially affecting his concentration.

*Objectives:*

* Protect Alex: Mario's primary goal is to ensure the safety of Alex. If the gang members are defeated or driven off, Alex will be grateful and potentially provide Mario with useful information or assistance in the future.
* Teach a Lesson: Subduing the gang without causing severe harm might serve as a valuable lesson, discouraging them from further criminal activities in the future.

*Outcome:*

* Success: If Mario successfully defeats or subdues the gang, they retreat, nursing their wounds. The local authorities may arrive afterward, providing an opportunity for Mario to share information about the gang's activities.
* Failure: If Mario fails, the gang members may escape, and the situation could escalate, leading to potential consequences for Mario and Alex.
