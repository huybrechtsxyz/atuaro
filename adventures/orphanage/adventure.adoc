== Summary
After talking about the social contract and their introduction to the world, the players create a character.

Ms Witchling will ask the characters to go in the basement to get refreshments for her guests that day. While in the basement they will have to fetch the drinks while avoiding the rats. If they investigate they will find a child locked up in the basement. There are some hidden valueables in that room if they can find them. If they succees then they can go to the carnival. They not gonna fail right... right...

While Hibiscus Tauwi (The Priest) comes to visit Ms Witchling, Aeria Jones (Weird) comes back inside and is not alone. She is surrounded by pixies. The pixies start fun and try to lure the children outside. They start harassing children if they do not comply. If no action is taken, the pixies will focus on a single child and lure / drag the child Timothy Butch (the sad one) or Gilad Shams (the bully) outside. Our heroes will need to defend the children.

The 11th day of Mahea [11/03/365 AR] is a lucky day. The Imbolc Carnival is in town. Ms Witchling made arrangements that allow the children to visit the carnival. The children heard from the older ones the exotic fruit is very special, but that Ms Witchling did not arrange a tasting. The children can go and visit the carnival, play the games, and maybe steal some of that fruit? They have to find a treasury map that leads to the next encounter.

Each year during the spring carnival the town of Kainga has held an annual tournament open to the bravest and brightest. The premise is simple. Enter the dungeon and emerge with the most Chips of Valour at the greatest speed.

*Extra Information*

During the Dark Ages of Europe, which lasted from the 5th to the 10th century, the seasonal transition from winter to spring was often referred to as "Candlemas" or "Imbolc". Candlemas was celebrated on February 2nd and marked the halfway point between the winter solstice and the spring equinox. Imbolc was a Gaelic festival celebrated on the first day of February and marked the beginning of spring in Ireland and Scotland. Both of these festivals celebrated the end of winter and the beginning of the agricultural season.

== To Do List

* Make the hardcore rules more clear to start with.
* Make the children 16 years old to start with?
* The rats can be made more assertive so they attack quicker
* Pixies can be more aggressive, strong, and do more damage
* Have fun at the carnival: make the tricks better
* Take a look at the tournament: make it more obvious what it is.
* Clown School: Flesh out Willie the clown and a possible reward
* Magician Trick: Rework act and possible reward

== Introduction and Welcome

Hi everyone and welcome to the session zero of your Atuaro adventure.

Just a reminder that in the Player Handbook you can find a lot of interesting things like:

* Basic Play
* Table Rules
* Game Rules

As mentioned in the Table Rules, I expect that you have a way of managing your character. The obvious ways is using a form fillable PDF or one of the many character apps that are available. A few examples are the Standard Character Sheet or the alternate sheet found in the public sheets folder. My personal preference is that you no longer use D&D Beyond in light of the O.G.L. controversy. An editable PDF, World Anvil, VTT has a good player character manager my preference would be one of these.

== Ineffable Games

image::{homedir}/assets/images/ineffable_games.jpg[align=center]

The world was a vast and ancient place, shaped by the will of powerful beings beyond the comprehension of mortals. At the center of it all stood Mount Celstia, a towering peak that reached to the very heavens. It was there, atop that sacred mountain, that the Allfather gods Ranginui and Papatanuku resided. They were the creators of all that existed, the bringers of light and life to a world that would otherwise have remained forever in darkness.

Gods play games with the fates of men. The game they play is somewhere between Dungeons and Dragons, Risk and Chess, with Diplomacy, Monopoly and Battleships thrown in for good measure along the way. Don't think the game is complicated though; gods don't have the patience for complex games. They prefer games that are short and violent. The game is played on a map of the world that is, on closer inspection, the world itself. If you look closely enough at the tiny pin that is Mount Celestia in the middle of the board, you can see the gods on top of it in their home playing the game. If you look closer still, you can see the board with a tiny Mount Celestia.

A youthful deity is competing against all the other gods. Ranginui and Papatanuku observe the spectacle with a mixture of amusement, shame, and confusion. Ohm, their newest, is unique in that they are only a few thousand years old. Trusted upon them by the new arrivals on Atuaro. Ohm has resulted in upheaval both in the world and in the established traditions and customs of the gods themselved. Ohm glares at the game board, frustrated. "I was winning!". "What went wrong in the last few centuries?" Ohm stares at the board once more, hoping to find an edge ...

It's 5 AM on a early freezing spring morning. The window and heavy dark green curtains do little to keep out the cold. You try to snuggle under the blanket for warmth, but no matter how you arrange it, you can't seem to get comfortable. "I'm only 8 years old," you think. "This blanket nonsense has got to stop. I just need it to be longer." Suddenly, you sit up and open your eyes. You find yourself floating in a void of blackness and silence, and the cold is biting. No matter how you try to move, there is no resistance. You are suspended in the darkness, frozen in place.

A massive eye towers over you, its curiosity and threat palpable. The only thing in sight is the enormous purplish-brown iris, and your reflection appears as nothing more than a speck of dust. The pupil is black with a tiny blue dot in the center, and as you gaze at it, you feel judged and weighed. Overcome with fear and freezing cold, your eyes are fixed on the blue speck. As you fall into the pupil, you pick up speed, the blue dot growing larger. The coldness is replaced by warmth and then heat as your fear increases. The blue dot transforms into a world, with vast oceans encircling a huge continent surrounded by archipelagos and isolated islands.

From a distance, the massive continent and its vast oceans come into view. The continent boasts towering mountains and dividing rivers that create diverse landscapes. On the east side is a circular sea, a bay so large it appears as if a chunk has been bitten out of the continent. It is surrounded by expansive plains used for farming and woods that turn into jungles in the south. In the west lies a massive desert, a place so devoid of water that its inhabitants do not believe in rain. Far to the north, arctic conditions blanket everything in ice and snow. The central mountain range holds the abode of the gods, Mount Celestia.

You experience a rush of air and the world speeds towards you. The city of Loukotokia, a bustling entrepreneurial hub nicknamed the "Anthill," is quickly approaching. Built on several hills near one of the major rivers on the continent, it flashes by on your right as you continue your rapid descent to Kainga, a small village just a day's journey from Loukotokia.

Kainga is a compact and tidy village, surrounded by lush green forests and rolling hills. The town is built around a central square, where the Common House, the Temple of the Ohm, and the market stalls are located. The streets of Kainga are semi-maintained dirt roads, lined with wooden houses, barns, and workshops. To the north of the central square lies Tobias' Forge, a large, smoky building that doubles as the blacksmith's workshop and store. The river that runs near Kainga provides water for the town's crops and livestock, and also serves as a source of fish for the townspeople. The fertile lands around Kainga are dotted with small farms, where the town's residents grow crops, raise livestock, and live out their peaceful lives.

You head towards a notorious establishment on the outskirts of the village. Just as you would crash into the roof, you wake up, jolting upright and hitting your head on the ceiling or the upper bunk of your bed. Sweaty and hot, your bed is soaking wet. You are lying in your bunk in one of the bedrooms at the House of Orphaned and Abandoned Offspring.

== Character Creation

To play in a role-playing game you will need a character. But as most players already did this plenty we are going to condense the information to what you need to know to play in Atuaro with links to relevant articles if you want to know more. As we are building a random generated character do not feel to fixated on your choices. People change with age.

Please create 3 characters in order and set their:

* Ability Scores
* Character Lineage
* Class Archetype
* Hit Points
* Basic Information

=== Ability Scores

The first order of business is to create your ability scores. Please use the Hardcore Mode to create your ability scores. For each ability score:

* In order from STRength to CHArisma
* Roll 3D6 ONCE in ORDER and note the result
* Keep track of the lowest die roll
* Calculate your standard modifier
* Subtract the lowest die role

=== Character Lineage

Characters in the world belong to a lineage which includes certain biological characteristics and defines some aspects of their physical appearance. Other things, such as a character’s speed and size, are also derived from their lineage.

Choose one of the playable races from the Atuaro handbook

If you wish to add a race please talk to your GM.

=== Class Archetype

Select one of the class archetypes.

* Martial, a character that martial prowess

* Expert, a character with special expertise (what expertise?)

=== Hit Points

At level zero, your character has 1 D4 Hit Die. Later the die type is determined by your class. At each Level, roll your class Hit Die and add that to your MAX HP. No CON modifier applies, no re-rolls, no max outcomes.

=== Basic Information

Please answer the following questions?

* How long have you been at the Witchling House?
* Were you brought here as a newly born?
* Or yesterday by your parents or their servant?
* Do you know why they brought you here?

Is there anything you would like to add?

* Personality traits

* A hobby, personal item from your past?

== Basement Dwellings

Ms Witchling will ask the characters to go in the basement to get refreshments for her guests that day. While in the basement they will have to fetch the drinks while avoiding the rats. If they investigate they will find a child locked up in the basement. There are some hidden valueables in that room if they can find them.

If they succees then they can go to the carnival. They not gonna fail right... right...

// SKIP THE STARS
Kids with good behaviour get a Star. On the other hand if you mucked about you get a Bolt. Stars are awarded to the highest performing children. Any child who fails will receive a Bolt, without exception.

* Earning eleven Bolts results in immediate expulsion. Unlike you, Ms Witchling does not muck about. 
* A Star can be used to forgive a small trespassing if you play it off.
* You can use 2 Stars to get rid of 1 Bolt.

=== Breakfast
> The room is cramped and has a stale smell. You awaken from a restless sleep and realise that you are not the only one who has had a nightmare. The first bell rings at 6 AM and the assigned orphans rise from their beds, some still groggy, to wash up and get dressed. The girls are assigned to do the housekeeping tasks while the boys clean the fireplaces. 
> 
> The head mistress, Ms Witchling, a thiefling woman in her early forties, oversees the orphans with an iron hand, believing that she can save them from themselves through strict discipline. Her motto is "you can never start young enough" or "they will need to learn sometime, so why not now." The priority is that the tasks are completed to her satisfaction not on who did what.
>
> At 06:30 AM, all the other Offspring in the orphanage are required to rise from their beds and get ready for the day. This involves washing up and getting dressed. It is mandatory for everyone to have breakfast before 07:00 AM as this is the set schedule for starting the day. This strict routine is maintained by Ms Witchling, who runs the house with an iron hand. She believes that starting young and enforcing strict discipline is necessary to help the children grow into well-behaved and responsible individuals. 
>
> At 07:00 AM precisely, Ms Witchling sounds a bell and everyone falls silent, taking their place behind the table. She turns to you, "What's your name again? Oh well, never mind. Please lead the prayers this morning."

Allow for players to roll-play this out if they want. Choose a player that has to preside the prayer moment. Remind them Ohm is the god to pray to. Even if they would have a different god. She will berate the character no matter what. If the GM is very impressed by the roll-play you may give a Star if they muck about they get a Bolt.

> Ms. Witchling reminds everyone of the guests arriving later that day and warns them to behave appropriately, reminding them of the consequences faced by Kenneth James McCormick. She then instructs someone to fetch two flagons of ale and wine, and to also one of water. *wait 2 seconds* What are you waiting for? Get on with it! An older offspring passes by "You seem flustered? Well hurry, the area is dark and there are rats" and then quickly leaves them to handle the task alone.

=== Objectives

=== Area 2 - Kegs [DC-10]

> A basement room filled with wooden kegs of various sizes stacked up against the walls. The room is dark with a little dim light from the stairs

The children will need to use the spigots, which requires a strength check to open.

=== Area 3 - Storage West [DC-10]

> A dark storage area in the basement. The air is musty and damp, carrying with it the scent of old and forgotten things. Wooden crates and boxes are stacked haphazardly against the walls, leaving narrow aisles in between.

Once someone is close to the door for room 4:

> You hear a soft, pitiful whimper. A sound filled with fear, sadness, and desperation. The whimpering is constant but fluctuates in volume. You can see a shadowy figure sitting hunched on some boxes.

If they succeed on a perception check:

> You hear disorganised skittering and scrabbling of random and erratic movement of little paws.

This room contains old and worn clothes and cheap items required to run the orphanage.

* Entering the room they pass through cobwebs.

    The spiders are harmless. But if you get walk through them you become frightened and drop everything you are carrying. In room 5 on the right wall they can find an old broom to clear the cobwebs. CON SAVE.
  
* Save the boy from the locked storage room.

=== Area 4 - Locked Room [DC-11]

The door of the room:

> The door is sturdy and appears to be made of heavy wood. A wooden box is blocking the door from the outside.

The room itself:

> The storage room is small and cramped with a musty smell of dampness. The lack of light adds to the claustrophobic feel and increases the sense of being trapped.

This room contains clothes, pottery for longer term storage and the more expensive items.

* 1d4 rats are in the room (minimum 2)

* Once Timmy has his stuff he will accompany the kids upstairs
* In one of the boxes there are 2 wooden swords and a shield.

=== Area 5 - Storage North [DC-10]

> This area of the basement is located near the stairs and is partially illuminated by its light. The dim light makes it difficult to see clearly, but you can make out the shapes of cluttered boxes and sacks, stacked haphazardly against the walls.

This room contains food, produce, grain. More expensive bottles of wine and beer. Candles.

* There is a broom near the right wall that can be used for the cobwebs.

=== Area 6 - The Well [DC-11]

> This section contain a well surrounded by a stone wall. It provides fresh water for the orphanage. A sturdy wooden lid covers the top of the well, and a rope and bucket hang down into the depths. The walls of the well are slick and slippery, and the water in the depths is dark and still. The well is deep and narrow, and there is no light at the bottom, making it difficult to see what lies below. 

* They need to put the buck in, pull it up with water, and fill the flagon.

=== Lunch

> It is noon and the priest presides lunch. +
_Blessed Noon, children. +
Let us begin with a moment of silence for everyone. +
For those that refuse to work +
For those who are not pure +
For those who do not BELIEVE +  
We keep those souls in our thoughts +
It serves to remind us that Ohm should never be taken for granted +
For evil never rests. It lurks beyond the veil waiting to strike +
We must remain ever vigilant +
Demons and false gods spring to mind, those who poison your soul +
It takes many forms and takes from our flock +
Those who have grappled with their maleficence before still struggle +
You, brothers and sisters, join me in prayer that we might ward off these evil spirits +
Only united we hope to keep its nefarious designs at bay on this sacred day +
together now! +
BEGONE DEVIL! We cast the out! +
We drive you from us! Breaker of oaths! Invader of souls! +
You shall hold no dominion here today +
So declares Ohm_  

At 12:00 AM the priests Hibiscus comes to vist Ms Witchling. He reads the prayer and joins in the food. Then they retreat to their private quarters and Krista brings them the drinks and comes out again to continue her neverending chores. Before the can listen to the door they will need to make a stealth check:

* [DC5] they can make a 1 perception check
* [DC10] they can make 2 perception checks
* [DC15] they can make 3 perception checks

If they listen to the door they will hear:

* [DC5] Usual town gossip 
* [DC7] Carnival is in town. On good behaviour they can go.
* [DC9] Hear the guards found a 'treasure map' which is located in the guard tent at the carnival
* [DC11] Hear the rumour about the affection of Cedric Oakheart to Ms Witchling
* [DC13] Hear the priest talk about the Bisshop being at the carnival
* [DC15] Hear the priest specifically ask about Cornus

=== Pixie Attack

> Aria Jones comes into the door startling the offspring that is listening to the door. "Ah ah ah snooty pooty. What would Ms Witchling say" she says coyly. +
+
What is more peculier she seems is accompanied by a group of small, winged creatures. Surrounded by little flying creatures that seem to try to get her to go outside again. She wearisomely swats at them and says "Oh stop it. Bugger of. Find some other victim". Which they promptly do.

The pixies will bother anyone who is arround and find victims in the orphanage to take outside. Once off the map, the child will be 'gone'.

After they seem to win the fight they notice a pixie flying upstairs. If they follow it they will see the pixie turning into a hag.  
If the buly or sad one are there, they will comment they expect great things from them.
This pixie requires a DC20 to perceive. 

* DC10 Perception check to see their true nature.

=== Area 8 - Animal Exhibit

> The cage full of young goblins is a smaller, more cramped enclosure. The goblins are squabbling and bickering amongst themselves, and occasionally snatching food from one another. Despite their small size and seemingly harmless demeanour, goblins are notoriously vicious and cunning creatures, and many have fallen victim to their ambushes and traps.
>
> The second cage in the tent of animals at the carnival contains a fierce and ferocious displacer beast, a powerful feline predator with six tentacle-like appendages that protrude from its shoulders.
>
>The cage of the owlbear is a large, sturdy wooden structure with thick metal bars. The bars are spaced closely together to prevent the owlbear from squeezing through, and the door is secured with a heavy padlock. Inside the cage, there is a large pile of straw for the owlbear to sleep on, and a shallow bowl of water in the corner. The owlbear itself is a fearsome creature with sharp claws and a powerful beak, and it paces back and forth restlessly in its cage, occasionally letting out a menacing growl.

If they are pleasent to him and can guess the number of goblins, he will share the secret of the treasury map.
He heard the guards talking to each other.

If they come to close the animal will try to bite attack for 1 damage.

*MAZE*

> Next to the animal exhibit is the entrance of the maze made of haystacks is marked by two tall, imposing columns, each topped with a fake stuffed horse head. The columns are connected by a wooden arch, with the words "Hunt a Goblin" painted in bold, bright letters. The archway is draped with a garland of brightly colored flowers and ribbons, creating a festive and inviting atmosphere.

> Looking better as you step closer to the entrance, you notice that the hay bales making up the walls of the maze have been badly arranged and not as stable as it should be.

Te moment they enter the maze the goblins escape. Yes: it was Galid but he made sure nobody knows. Some of the goblins come to hide in the maze. Will attack when they feel threathened.

Throw higher then 18 you know the exact number. The highest number wins.  
Winner gets 1 extra INT score point.

=== Area 9 - Guard Room [DC12]

> The Tythingman's tent is a functional and utilitarian space, designed to provide a base of operations. It is made of durable canvas and supported by wooden poles. Inside the tent, there is a simple wooden table with a few chairs, where the Tythingman and his assistants can sit and keep an eye on the comings and goings of the carnival. There is also a small bedroll in one corner of the tent, where the Tythingman can rest during his long shifts. There seems to be a map on the table that looks like a treasure map.

One of the Tythingman is sleeping on the bedrol. Fail a stealthcheck to awaken him. If other guards see you enter they will call out to leave the place alone. Inside there is a short sword, shield, dagger, and a spear. And a set of cloth armor.  
The treasury map is on the table.

=== Area 10 - Central Market square [DC10]

> The center of the carnival is a bustling marketplace where vendors have set up colourful stalls to sell their wares. The stalls are arranged in neat rows, each one adorned with bright banners and flags that flap in the breeze. The smell of cooking food wafts through the air, mingling with the sounds of laughter, music, and chatter. The vendors are a diverse group, selling everything from fresh produce to handmade crafts, clothing, and trinkets. Their wares are displayed in colourful arrays, catching the eye of passersby with their vibrant hues and intricate designs.

Their are various vendors who work on the small market.

=== Area 1 - Item Selection [DC12]

> Gormack calls out **YourTeamName**. His voice seeming to come from everywhere. "Alright boys and girls, you're up! You did sign the waiver... right ... ? You sure you old enough ? Ah whatever ... Follow me and we'll get you started"
> 
> Gormack leads you through the first doors and through a stone pathway lit by torches on either side. He opens up a set of wooden double doors at the end and lets you in.
> 
> Inside you see a small square room with shelves lining the walls with various items. "You can pick one and only one item from the wall."

Gormack leads the party down the stairs to a room that is lined with shelves and items on the walls. There is a set of iron doors to the north. They will each get to choose one item from the list below. After they have each selected their final item, Gormack wishes them good luck and opens the iron doors to the north before closing them behind the party.

* They may attempt to sneak an item past Wake with a slight of hand DC 12 (at your discretion if the item would be feasible to sneak).

=== Area 2 - Clockwork Soldiers [DC-10]

> After entering the room, Gormack closes the iron door behind you. You're standing in a rectangular room. Much like the past room it looks like it is carved out of stone. There are torches lining the wall. Lighting up the room as well as a chandelier hanging from the vaulted ceiling. There are two long tables going down the center of the room.
> 
> Standing at either side of a large bronze door in the far wall is a 6-foot-tall soldier made entirely out of metal and gears. You see steam poring out of their backs every few seconds through vents. They each hold a metal shield as well as a long-sword. They are currently stranding in a defensive positions, though not acknowledging you.

*todo: clockwork soldier**

=== Area 3 - Dragon Forest [DC-11]

![](./../assets/tokens/medusa_token.png)

> As you swing the door open you see something that actually takes your brain a moment to comprehend. It looks as if you're in the middle of a forest. The "room" seems huge, there are a few trees scattered around and the're about 20 feet tall. And even as mall pond. Looking up you do not see a ceiling. But walls on the far end making up a 100 by 100 square room. Straight ahead from the door you see a 30 foot high stone wall that has been smoothed down with a ledge atop of it. You can't make out what's up there form this angle.

This room of the dungeon has been made to look like a small forest. The door is on the ledge in the northeast corner of the room, high up on the ledge. The party will need to get up to the top of the ledge and then solve a puzzle to get the key which opens the locked door (unless they have another way to open the door such as a lock-pick).

* There is one chip in the pond (perception check to discover it, advantage if they jump in the pond) 
* There is one chip in the top of the tree nearest to the cliff (perception check to discover)

 Once your party manages to make it to the top of the cliff one way or another, read the below text.
 
> Up here you can see that it is a smooth flat surface of stone much like the wall below. There is a large iron door against the far wall to the east. 
> 
> There is also a life-sized stone statue of a medusa planted between you and the door.

The door is locked (DC lock-picking to open or using a key to open). The medusa has a necklace around her neck, but it is turned to stone and a part of the statue. Let your players get creative with how they get the key. Perhaps they show the medusa her own reflection in a mirror or the pond water below which you can choose to animate the full medusa, or just the key. Maybe they carefully chisel the necklace away from the statue and use the key while it’s stone. This is a chance for your players to get creative.

=== Area 4 - Portcullis Puzzle [DC10]

![](./../assets/tokens/clockwork_spider.png)

> As you walk through the iron door, you see a rectangular room with wooden floors. The room is split in half by a portcullis directly in front of the door with narrow walls on either side. Through the bars you can make out a door on the far end and a few wooden boxes and barrels on the other side.

This room is a mix of combat and puzzle. For your party to find a way to open the portcullis, they will first need to find two pressure plates on the floor (DC investigation or perception). Once they step on both of the pressure plates and hear the clicks (at least 30 pounds is needed to trigger), the portcullis raises up. 

* If they remove pressure from the plates, then the gate closes (DC athletics/acrobatics check +2 difficulty to make it through before it closes). 
* Start with 2 spiders and add when needed

On the other side of the portcullis there are wooden barrels and crates in the far back corners of the room. Hiding behind the crates is a clockwork spider currently rolled into a metallic ball, on either side; for a total of two spiders. Once a player approaches within 5 feet of a box, they will unroll and begin to attack. During the combat, the party will most likely be split while two of the party are at the entrance holding open the portcullis.

* There is one chip in the boxes. Players will need to search through or break the boxes. If they search through each box and barrel, it will take some time (roll a 1d20 to determine how many minutes, with the number rolled being the number of minutes). If they smash open the boxes, have them roll a perception or investigation check to search the debris for the chip.

=== Area 5 - Rest and Relaxation

>As the door swings open you are greeted by the smell of sweets as you see a room with plush chairs scattered around next to tables that are filled with all manner of juice and cookies taking up the majority of the tables. You see a banner that says "Rest and Relaxation Room".
>You hear the voice of Gormack fill the room "This is the rest and relaxation room. If you wish to rest up in the room you may, but remember your time will continue!"

Here the party has the choice to take a short rest (adding 30 minutes to their timer) or to continue on without resting.

* There is one chip in the hourglass. If the players break it open, they’re able to find it easily.

=== Area 6 - Individual Trials [DC11]

> Straight ahead of you are six doors. Above each door is a word. From left to right you read: Strength, Finesse, Intellect, Bravery, Character, Devotion.
> A booming voice echoes throughout the walls. "You must each now make a choice. You will each get to choose one door. One door only!"

The players are presented with a choice. Each player must choose one door and one door only. The options are Strength, Finesse, Intellect, Bravery, Character, Devotion. If there are more than 5 players, the extra players may choose to instead go through a side door along the wall that does not have a word above the door. It leads straight to area 7 and offers no chips. Above each door has a quote under the one-word description. These quotes are at the start of their read-aloud text boxes. There is a key near the exit to one of the rooms (you choose one that a character chooses to place it) that has the chip of valour symbol on it. Above the key reads “The key to your success.”. This key can be used in the final boss fight.

*Area 6-1 Strength*

> Above the door reads "Might can be measured in more ways then one." There doesn't appear to be anyway to open this door until you look down and see that there are fingerholds at the bottom as you need to be able to lift the door before even trying your trial.

Once a character opens up this door (Athletics check) they find themselves in an empty room save for an arm-wrestling machine at the center of the room. Underneath the machine is a box with reinforced glass where a coin of valour can be seen. If the character beats the arm-wrestling machine (Athletics check) then the top folds over on a hinge and allows the players to retrieve the chip. A character may also attempt to break the glass with an athletics check (+2 difficulty). After completing the challenge (win or lose) they will be able to go through the door at the far end of the room and meet back up with the others.

> In the center of this otherwise bare room is a strange contraption mounted on top of a box with a thick glass box. It looks like a clockwork arm stuck in an arm-wrestling position. Inside the reinforced glass box you see a single chip of valour. On the far end of the hall you see another door.

*Area 6-2 Finesse*

> Above the door reads "Everything has a weight to it. Not until you learn to control your own will you be able to control others". Inside this room you see a series of stone platforms that are raised above the ground stretching the full length of this corridor. At the end you see a pedestal with what looks like a chip of valour placed atop it. The pedestal is on a platform that leads to a doorway.

There are several checks to be made in this room. 

* The first is acrobatics to jump from platform to platform (one check should suffice here unless you’d like to add more). If a player fails a check, they will fall 10 feet to the solid floor below taking 1d6 bludgeoning damage.
  
	There is a ladder built into the wall on the entrance side for them to climb up and attempt again. Once they get to the pedestal, there will be an investigation or perception check to notice the weight-sensitive tile that the chip is currently resting on. 

* They will need to replace the chip with something of similar weight (5 pounds or less) or else arrows will shoot out from small holes in the wall, causing a dexterity saving throw with 1d6 piercing damage if they fail.

*Area 6-3 Intellect*

>Above the door reads "To solve this room, you must be brighter than half of everyone.". Inside this room you see a table with a stack of 12 chips of valour on the table. Also, on the table is s scale with 2 arms and trays commonly used to balance food and money at a grocer. There are 3 vertical tally marks currently glowing blue in front of the scale.
>
>Written on a scroll next to the scale it says: "before you are 12 chips of valour. Only one is true, the other 11, worthless. The 11 imposters are the same wight while the true chip is slightly heavier.  You may use the scale only three times to try to discover the one true chip of valour. If you leave the room with more than 1 chip, you will be penalised."

This is a common logic puzzle with a few solutions. You may want to research all of the various solutions prior to running this section, or you can just reason out if the character’s plan would indeed work or not.

If they’re not able to solve the puzzle and just choose a chip at random, then roll a 1d12. If you hit 12, then they chose the correct chip. If they’re able to narrow down the chip to a smaller group, then roll the die closest to that amount. If the die lands on its max value, then they have chosen the correct chip. 

One sample solution would be to split the chips into 3 stacks of 4. Place a stack of 4 on either side of the scale. If they balance out, then you know that the heavier chip is in the pile which is not weighed. You can then place 2 chips on both scales from the group that has yet to be weighed for your second use of the scale. Whichever side is heavier, take those two and weigh them against each other. The heavier chip is the true chip of valour. There is an exit door at the end of the corridor.

*Area 6-4 Bravery*

> Above the door reads "Monsters, demons, dragons, and the undead. None of these hold a candle to what lies behind this door."

Inside the hallway the room is well lit by torches lining the wall with a small table with a single lit candle on top of it. When the character first walks in they get a quick glimpse of something they fear at the end of the hallway (if you’re not sure what your player’s character would fear, you could always consider a lich or a mind- flayer).

The torches then go out, leaving just the lit candle and making it too dark to see the end of the hallway where the creature was. The goal of this corridor is that they character is meant to blow out the candle, casting the room into total darkness. There is a chip of valour underneath the table where the candle was resting, but it is concealed by a modified illusion spell. 

This spell hides the chip as long as there is any source of light in the room. Once the character reaches the end of the hallway, they will find a door leading to the exit.

*Area 6-5 Character*

> Above the door reads "Charisma is such a versatile tool. Through fear or friendship, being charismatic can leave a lasting memory of a person." The inside of this corridor is remarkably bare. It is a straight passage to a door on the far end. Flanking the door on either side are clockwork soldiers.

* The statue on the left (Stix) has two Chips of Valour. The statue on the right (Sox) none. I think it’s only fair that they share the chips. Let your player come up with a compromise to try to get one of the chips (or both) themselves. Have a persuasion, deception, or intimidation check depending on their method.

This corridor is meant to be a role-play puzzle. The statues are able to move from the waist up with their feet forming out of the ground. They are 10 feet apart with the door right in the middle. The statues are sentient and able to speak. They very much enjoy their life and are best friends. They love this time of year because it’s the only time they get to interact with anyone other than themselves. Have fun with this encounter. Choose any of the below options for the character to win over a chip of valour (or 2!). 

Alternatives:
* Use the classic one guard always lies and one always tells the truth. If they’re able to find out which statue is telling the truth, then they will give the character a chip.
* The statues get awfully bored down here and love stories. If your character tells them an entertaining story (performance check) then they will gift the player a chip.

*Area 6-6 Devotion*

> Above the door reads "How much would you give to prove your devotion? Would you give it all?"
> The inside of this corridor is divided by walls of hot blue flames spaced evenly until the back wall. There does not appear to be a way around the flames.

This puzzle is meant to test the character’s faith and devotion. Every wall of flames they walk through will cut them down by half of their current health (so each wall of flames will do progressively less damage but still get them very close to zero). Make sure to describe the intense burning and pain as they walk through each wall of magical fire. Once they walk through the fifth wall of fire, they will fall unconscious briefly, landing in a pool of cleansing water just in front of the exit. This will reinvigorate them and bring them back to full health (even if they were lower than full at the start of this room). There is also a single chip of valour in the 5-foot-deep pool of water.

=== Area 7 - Monty Hall Puzzle

After all of the players have completed their tasks and have exited their rooms, they find themselves in a hallway with one single iron door across from them all.

> This next room has bright blue and orange carpeted floors and three large purple doors set in the back of the room. One labelled with 1 , one with a 2, one with a 3.  On the wall to the left is a plain iron door.
>
> You hear the voice of Gormack amplified in the room "You've got to know when to risk it and when to play it safe while you're out in the world. Will you wager 5 chips of valour to see what is behind one of these 3 doors? Or will you save your chips and continue on your path?"

This is the classic Monty Hall puzzle. Once the players choose a door, Gormack’s voice will respond “Very good choice! Now, if we remove door, would you reconsider your choice and choose the other door or would you stick with door?”

Whichever door is chosen, the players will need to slide 5 chips into a slot in the center of the door to open it.

1. Behind door 1 is a mimic chest that attacks once they attempt to open it.
2. Behind door 2 are 10 Chips of Valour
3. Behind door 3 is a Potion of Superior Healing

After the characters have made their final choice and have finished with their door, they may head to the final room of the dungeon.

> Above the door exiting this room inscribed in blue arcane letters is the message "A good adventurer knows there is always more to lose."

=== Area 8 - Clockwork Dragon [DC-12]

![](./../assets/tokens/clockwork_dragon.png)

> You enter into this next room that looks to be a massive cave. The ceiling has to over 100 feet high and from wall to wall is nearly as far. There are large stalagmites and stalactites all around the room, some growing to be over 15 feet tall. You see what looks like a crumpled pile of scrap metal in the center of the room, taking up a huge portion of the cave. Near the pile is a roaring bonfire reaching fifteen feet high. There is a door on the far wall with a lare orange letters that reads Exit.
>  
> You hear a booming voice of Gormack say "What would a dungeon be without a dragon!"
>  
> At that moment you see steam start to pour out from the pile of scrap in the center of the room. As parts start to hiss and whir and clank together you see the form begin to take shape as aa massive clockwork dragon slowly begins to take to its feet, staring down at you. The whole room is lit by only the massive brazier behind the dragon.

*NPC: Clockwork Dragon*
Medium construct, neutral
Armor Class 12
Hit Points 24 (6d10 + 18)
Speed 30 ft, fly 60 ft.
Melee Weapon Attack: +6 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 15
(2d10 +4) piercing damage.

	STR     DEX     CON     INT     WIS     CHA
	14 (+2) 10 (+0) 12 (+1) 10 (+0) 11 (+0) 10 (+0)

* While the clockwork dragon remains motionless, it is indistinguishable from a pile of scrap metal.
* Steam Breath (Recharge 5-6). The clockwork dragon exhales steam in a 15-foot cone. Each creature in that area must make a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw, taking 14 (4d6) fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

The clockwork dragon is meant to be a challenging fight that has the opportunity for the party to flee instead of finishing the fight (the door on the far end of the room has a large exit sign and is unlocked). If they are able to kill the dragon, they will be rewarded with quite a few chips.  

* The chest of the dragon requires the key that one of the characters should have picked up from their trial room. The dragon’s stat block will explain how this can be used.There are a few chips in this area:
* The dragon’s body has a total of 5 chips on its body. These chips have the same illusion that the bravery trial used, which means they will need the room to be darkened to find them or use a detect magic spell. Consider leaving out the illusion mechanic if no one used the bravery door as they would then have no way of knowing.
* There are two chips at the bottom of the fire. It will most likely need to be extinguished for them to be visible or for them to be picked up

=== Area 9 - Waiting room
The below read-aloud text is structured as if the characters are the first team to enter the dungeon. It will need some adjustments if there have been other teams that have completed. There will be other adventurers lounging on the couches and the score board in the center will be updated accordingly.

> You are greeted by a large circular room that has couches lining the walls. In the center of the room is a Scoreboard with 10 slots in it. Gormack is the only on in the room lounging on the couches when you all enter. He says. Congratulations on completing the dungeon! Looks you all all even survived and in one piece! How many chips did you all manage to gather?

*THE REFUNDABLES (RIGHT)*
* MERLIN A human male warlock. Merlin is a barber by trade and always has time to give a quick haircut (for a price).
* ULTREX Ultex is a warforged paladin that was created to defend Faerun from Illithid invaders. He is also deathly afraid of spiders. 
* CLYDE REEMERSTAT Clyde the goliath barbarian spent most of his life on a small farm dreaming of becoming a blacksmith. With the winnings from the competition he will be able to afford an apprenticeship.

*THE FUNKY FOUR*
* MINLEY Minley is a 70-year-old high elf warlock. She dresses in pale white robes and has bright white hair. She has worked hard to gain the attention of her patron and to gain control of her powers.
* CLAIRE RUNEFORGE Claire is a young dwarven barbarian. She has red curly loose hair and thick muscled arms. She is does not speak often and instead opts to let her strength and axe do the talking.

* UTHUR Uthor is a silver dragonborn paladin. He takes his oaths seriously. His role in the group is to mostly stop them from having too much fun.

=== Conclusion
Gormack will collect all of the chips and take note on their clipboard. They’ll then grab a plank that has the party’s team name on it and slot it into the corresponding slot (first place if they’re the first team back). To determine the results of the competition, consult the table below. Feel free to fudge things in favor of the party if you think everyone would have a better time if they had won! That’s what this is all about isn’t it? Having fun!

You have quite a few options for the rewards for this dungeon. As the DM, you’ll know the currency of your campaign more than anyone. One suggestion would be to have the first-place prize be 100 GP, second-place 50 GP and third-place 25 GP. As for a magical item for the grand prize winners, you could either have a magic item you would like your players to have and use this as a chance for them to earn it or you could roll on the table of common magic items below. You could give your party one item or an item per player.
