== Summary
After talking about the social contract and their introduction to the world, the players create a character.

Ms Witchling will ask the characters to go in the basement to get refreshments for her guests that day. While in the basement they will have to fetch the drinks while avoiding the rats. If they investigate they will find a child locked up in the basement. There are some hidden valueables in that room if they can find them. If they succees then they can go to the carnival. They not gonna fail right... right...

== To Do List
* Make the hardcore rules more clear to start with.
* Make the children 16 years old to start with?
* The rats can be made more assertive so they attack quicker
* Pixies can be more aggressive, strong, and do more damage
* Have fun at the carnival: make the tricks better
* Take a look at the tournament: make it more obvious what it is.

== Introduction and Welcome
Hi everyone and welcome to the session zero of your Atuaro adventure.

Just a reminder that in the Player Handbook you can find a lot of interesting things like:
* Basic Play
* Table Rules
* Game Rules

As mentioned in the Table Rules, I expect that you have a way of managing your character. The obvious ways is using a form fillable PDF or one of the many character apps that are available. A few examples are the Standard Character Sheet or the alternate sheet found in the public sheets folder. My personal preference is that you no longer use D&D Beyond in light of the O.G.L. controversy. An editable PDF, World Anvil, VTT has a good player character manager my preference would be one of these.

== Ineffable Games

image::{homedir}/assets/images/ineffable_games.jpg[align=center]

The world was a vast and ancient place, shaped by the will of powerful beings beyond the comprehension of mortals. At the center of it all stood Mount Celstia, a towering peak that reached to the very heavens. It was there, atop that sacred mountain, that the Allfather gods Ranginui and Papatanuku resided. They were the creators of all that existed, the bringers of light and life to a world that would otherwise have remained forever in darkness.

Gods play games with the fates of men. The game they play is somewhere between Dungeons and Dragons, Risk and Chess, with Diplomacy, Monopoly and Battleships thrown in for good measure along the way. Don't think the game is complicated though; gods don't have the patience for complex games. They prefer games that are short and violent. The game is played on a map of the world that is, on closer inspection, the world itself. If you look closely enough at the tiny pin that is Mount Celestia in the middle of the board, you can see the gods on top of it in their home playing the game. If you look closer still, you can see the board with a tiny Mount Celestia.

A youthful deity is competing against all the other gods. Ranginui and Papatanuku observe the spectacle with a mixture of amusement, shame, and confusion. Ohm, their newest, is unique in that they are only a few thousand years old. Trusted upon them by the new arrivals on Atuaro. Ohm has resulted in upheaval both in the world and in the established traditions and customs of the gods themselved. Ohm glares at the game board, frustrated. "I was winning!". "What went wrong in the last few centuries?" Ohm stares at the board once more, hoping to find an edge ...

It's 5 AM on a early freezing spring morning. The window and heavy dark green curtains do little to keep out the cold. You try to snuggle under the blanket for warmth, but no matter how you arrange it, you can't seem to get comfortable. "I'm only 8 years old," you think. "This blanket nonsense has got to stop. I just need it to be longer." Suddenly, you sit up and open your eyes. You find yourself floating in a void of blackness and silence, and the cold is biting. No matter how you try to move, there is no resistance. You are suspended in the darkness, frozen in place.

A massive eye towers over you, its curiosity and threat palpable. The only thing in sight is the enormous purplish-brown iris, and your reflection appears as nothing more than a speck of dust. The pupil is black with a tiny blue dot in the center, and as you gaze at it, you feel judged and weighed. Overcome with fear and freezing cold, your eyes are fixed on the blue speck. As you fall into the pupil, you pick up speed, the blue dot growing larger. The coldness is replaced by warmth and then heat as your fear increases. The blue dot transforms into a world, with vast oceans encircling a huge continent surrounded by archipelagos and isolated islands.

From a distance, the massive continent and its vast oceans come into view. The continent boasts towering mountains and dividing rivers that create diverse landscapes. On the east side is a circular sea, a bay so large it appears as if a chunk has been bitten out of the continent. It is surrounded by expansive plains used for farming and woods that turn into jungles in the south. In the west lies a massive desert, a place so devoid of water that its inhabitants do not believe in rain. Far to the north, arctic conditions blanket everything in ice and snow. The central mountain range holds the abode of the gods, Mount Celestia.

You experience a rush of air and the world speeds towards you. The city of Loukotokia, a bustling entrepreneurial hub nicknamed the "Anthill," is quickly approaching. Built on several hills near one of the major rivers on the continent, it flashes by on your right as you continue your rapid descent to Kainga, a small village just a day's journey from Loukotokia.

Kainga is a compact and tidy village, surrounded by lush green forests and rolling hills. The town is built around a central square, where the Common House, the Temple of the Ohm, and the market stalls are located. The streets of Kainga are semi-maintained dirt roads, lined with wooden houses, barns, and workshops. To the north of the central square lies Tobias' Forge, a large, smoky building that doubles as the blacksmith's workshop and store. The river that runs near Kainga provides water for the town's crops and livestock, and also serves as a source of fish for the townspeople. The fertile lands around Kainga are dotted with small farms, where the town's residents grow crops, raise livestock, and live out their peaceful lives.

You head towards a notorious establishment on the outskirts of the village. Just as you would crash into the roof, you wake up, jolting upright and hitting your head on the ceiling or the upper bunk of your bed. Sweaty and hot, your bed is soaking wet. You are lying in your bunk in one of the bedrooms at the House of Orphaned and Abandoned Offspring.

== Character Creation

To play in a role-playing game you will need a character. But as most players already did this plenty we are going to condense the information to what you need to know to play in Atuaro with links to relevant articles if you want to know more. As we are building a random generated character do not feel to fixated on your choices. People change with age.

Please create 3 characters in order and set their
* Ability Scores
* Character Lineage
* Class Archetype
* Hit Points
* Basic Information

=== Ability Scores
The first order of business is to create your ability scores. Please use the Hardcore Mode to create your ability scores. For each ability score:

* In order from STRength to CHArisma
* Roll 3D6 ONCE in ORDER and note the result
* Keep track of the lowest die roll
* Calculate your standard modifier
* Subtract the lowest die role

=== Character Lineage
Characters in the world belong to a lineage which includes certain biological characteristics and defines some aspects of their physical appearance. Other things, such as a character’s speed and size, are also derived from their lineage.

Choose one of the playable races from the Atuaro handbook

If you wish to add a race please talk to your GM.

=== Hit Points
At level zero, your character has 1 D4 Hit Die. Later the die type is determined by your class. At each Level, roll your class Hit Die and add that to your MAX HP. No CON modifier applies, no re-rolls, no max outcomes.

=== Basic Information
Please answer the following questions?

* How long have you been at the Witchling House?
* Were you brought here as a newly born?
* Or yesterday by your parents or their servant?
* Do you know why they brought you here?

Is there anything you would like to add?

== Basement Dwellings
Ms Witchling will ask the characters to go in the basement to get refreshments for her guests that day. While in the basement they will have to fetch the drinks while avoiding the rats. If they investigate they will find a child locked up in the basement. There are some hidden valueables in that room if they can find them.

If they succees then they can go to the carnival. They not gonna fail right... right...

// SKIP THE STARS
Kids with good behaviour get a Star. On the other hand if you mucked about you get a Bolt. Stars are awarded to the highest performing children. Any child who fails will receive a Bolt, without exception.

* Earning eleven Bolts results in immediate expulsion. Unlike you, Ms Witchling does not muck about. 
* A Star can be used to forgive a small trespassing if you play it off.
* You can use 2 Stars to get rid of 1 Bolt.

=== Breakfast
> The room is cramped and has a stale smell. You awaken from a restless sleep and realise that you are not the only one who has had a nightmare. The first bell rings at 6 AM and the assigned orphans rise from their beds, some still groggy, to wash up and get dressed. The girls are assigned to do the housekeeping tasks while the boys clean the fireplaces. 
> 
> The head mistress, Ms Witchling, a thiefling woman in her early forties, oversees the orphans with an iron hand, believing that she can save them from themselves through strict discipline. Her motto is "you can never start young enough" or "they will need to learn sometime, so why not now." The priority is that the tasks are completed to her satisfaction not on who did what.
>
> At 06:30 AM, all the other Offspring in the orphanage are required to rise from their beds and get ready for the day. This involves washing up and getting dressed. It is mandatory for everyone to have breakfast before 07:00 AM as this is the set schedule for starting the day. This strict routine is maintained by Ms Witchling, who runs the house with an iron hand. She believes that starting young and enforcing strict discipline is necessary to help the children grow into well-behaved and responsible individuals. 
>
> At 07:00 AM precisely, Ms Witchling sounds a bell and everyone falls silent, taking their place behind the table. She turns to you, "What's your name again? Oh well, never mind. Please lead the prayers this morning."

Allow for players to roll-play this out if they want. Choose a player that has to preside the prayer moment. Remind them Ohm is the god to pray to. Even if they would have a different god. She will berate the character no matter what. If the GM is very impressed by the roll-play you may give a Star if they muck about they get a Bolt.

> Ms. Witchling reminds everyone of the guests arriving later that day and warns them to behave appropriately, reminding them of the consequences faced by Kenneth James McCormick. She then instructs someone to fetch two flagons of ale and wine, and to also one of water. *wait 2 seconds* What are you waiting for? Get on with it! An older offspring passes by "You seem flustered? Well hurry, the area is dark and there are rats" and then quickly leaves them to handle the task alone.

=== Objectives

*Goal*

. Retrieve 3 flagons from the basement: 1 Beer, 1 wine, 1 water.
. **SECRET** Save the child Timmy that is locked in room 4 by the bully Gilad.

*Blessings* +
In order to take one of the blessings they will need to convince a senior if they see them take it.

. There is a lantern in the hallway
. There are a big knife and meat cleaver in the kitchen
. In the common room near the fireplace is a firepoke

*Obstacles*

1. The house has 5 flagons for this purpose. Every time you break one. That is 1 Bolts for all characters. 
2. The basement is dark. Without the lantern found in the kitchen, they will not be able to see beyond the immediate vicinity of the stairs 5 ft.
3. There are rats in the basement.
    * Rats only attack if attacked first, the slightest provocation will do  
	* Holding full flagon? Athletics check for not tripping on rats.
4. Between room 2 and 3 there are cobwebs from spiders. The spiders are harmless. But if you get walk through them you become frightened and drop everything you are carrying. In room 5 on the right wall they can find an old broom to clear the cobwebs.
5. Save the boy (Timmy) from the locked storage room. The child will be scared of the other children. Find at least two of his 'attributes' to get him to come with you.
	* Players can easily find the items (no check needed, just the right action)  
	* His teddy can be found in room 2 (between some barrels)  
	* His blanket can be found in room 5 (middle on the floor to room 6)  
	* His small tin soldier toy is in room 3 (just behind the wall on the left)
