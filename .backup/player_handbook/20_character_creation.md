## Creating a Character
Your first step in playing an adventure in the game is to imagine and create a character of your own. Your character is a combination of game statistics, role-playing hooks, and your imagination. You choose a lineage (such as human or dwarf) and a class (such as fighter or wizard). Invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of your character. Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the world.

Before you dive into the character building, think about the kind of adventurer you want to play. You might be a courageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or a flamboyant wizard. Or you might be more interested in an unconventional character, such as a brawny rogue who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who picks off enemies from afar. Do you like fantasy fiction featuring dwarves or elves? Try building a character of one of those lineages. Do you want your character to be the toughest adventurer at the table? Consider a class like barbarian or paladin. Once you have a character in mind, follow the steps in this builder in order, making decisions that reflect the character you want. Your conception of your character might evolve with each choice you make. What's important is that you come to the table with a character you're excited to play.

## Character Setup
The next step also includes various preferences for your character. You can proceed with the default options or make changes if desired. Make sure to ask the game master about certain requirements. He or she might request a specific setup.[Read more](21_character_setup.md).

## Ability Scores
Much of what your character does in the game depends on his or her six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. By default we roll 3D6 ONCE for each attribute. Record that score. Proceed in sequence rolling six times (hardcore mode). [Read more](21_character_abilities.md)

## Select a Lineage
Every character belongs to a lineage, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the D&D world. The most commonly known lineages are dwarves, elves, halfiings, and humans. [Read more](22_character_lineage.md) or see [Playable Lineages](tables/player_lineages.md).

## Select a Background
If a culture tells how a character started, their background helps outline where their journey led. There are a number of backgrounds to choose from each of which provides bonuses to your ability scores, additional proficiencies, and features your character can use while adventuring backgrounds gives a character proficiency in skills, tools, additional languages, and most backgrounds provides a package of starting equipment.
