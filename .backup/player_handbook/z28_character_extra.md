[h2]Languages[/h2]
Your race indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet. Choose your languages from the Languages table. With your DM's permission, you can instead choose a language from the Exotic or Secret Languages table, such as thieves' cant or the tongue of druids. Creatures that speak different dialects of the same language can communicate with one another.
