# Circusfolk

**Tags:**  #character #culture  

Circusfolk value wit, surprise, and daring which they display in both their lifestyle and their folktales. While some communities are found in villages and insular neighbourhoods, they are most famous for their travelling carnivals. These troupes often began as just a handful of entrepreneurial entertainers but blossomed into big circuses with caravans complete with support staff, spouses, and new family members. Orphans, runaways, and misfits of all heritages find a new family among circusfolk. 

The circusfolk oral tradition is exceedingly rich and best known for its trickster characters. These mythological trickster-heroes are numerous and diverse — some never fail, others undermine their successes through their own folly. They all turn the world upside down. A circusfolk storyteller’s excellence is judged not by their perfect recall but by their improvisation and engagement with the audience. All this reveals the unspoken message of circusfolk stories: anything can change. Characters raised in the circusfolk culture share a variety of traits in common with one another.
