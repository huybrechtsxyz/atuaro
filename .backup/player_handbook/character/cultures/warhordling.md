# Warhordling

**Tags:**  #character #culture 

Some war hordes obliterate the target of their wrath within the day and life simply returns to normal but others can last a lifetime. When the offender is an entire nation or a powerful figure like a sovereign or tyrant, the march can seem to go on forever. Warhordling life is driven by one simple goal: the destruction of their foe. When war hordes last for years, decades, or even centuries, generations of people are raised only knowing war. The elders may recount memories of happier days, but the songs and ballads that recount their history slowly become war chants.While hatred is often a poor leader, it is not always in the wrong. War hordes that rally against hated tyrants often find themselves accumulating banners from disparate forces, whether small ragtag bands or entire armies. Characters raised in the arhordling culture share a variety of traits in common with one another.
