# Godbound

**Tags:**  #character #culture 

The godbound were raised among the faithful. Such communities vary from temples and monasteries to massive theocracies that span entire continents, their rulers either divine or the anointed representatives of greater entities. The nature of your faith community can vary by theology, structure, and goodwill, and the environment might be egalitarian or hierarchical. Most religious peoples strive towards virtue, but even they pose the risk of abuse, and at the heart of certain communities lies a dark secret or conspiracy the likes of which might shatter the faith of any follower. One’s religion of birth need not always be their religious identity. People leave their religious communities for reasons both good and ill— some faiths send trusted envoys on missions, and others are destroyed by stronger forces. Communities also exile or punish members who commit sins, though some are nurturing, caring cultures which emphasize the wellbeing of all.Characters raised in the godbound culture share a variety of traits in common with one another.
