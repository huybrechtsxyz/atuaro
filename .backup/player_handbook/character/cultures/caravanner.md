# Caravanner

**Tags:**  #character #culture 

Sometimes societies are overturned by war and conflict, and there isnâ€™t always a homeland to return to once the war is over. Refugees with nowhere to go often go nowhere together, forming great roaming caravans. They travel along the migratory routes of wild animal herds, or from city to city as travelling merchants, or to cities unafraid of a few hundred or a few thousand travelers suddenly arriving on their doorsteps. With no land to call their own the caravans make the roads their home. Wagons and carts are loaded up with everything that made their homeland theirs, songs herald their arrival, and colorful pennants wave behind them as they go. It can be an appealing lifestyle, and quite often runaways escape on caravans. Caravan life can be harsh and dangerous, but it is still a life of adventure on the open road. Characters raised in the caravanner culture share a variety of traits in common with one another.
