# Hill Dwarf

**Tags:**  #character #culture 

Some dwarves never settle in underground kingdoms. They live in surface communities, trading, learning, and creating. Known as hill dwarves, they are gregarious, friendly, and worldly. No dwarves are more social and artistic than hill dwarves; after all, it’s easier to sell your goods if people like you. While they don’t consider art to be creation in the same sense as crafting something from a forge, hill dwarves share a deep love for music, poetry, theater, and literature. Many a song or play about the rise and fall of mountain dwarf empires was actually written by troupes of hill dwarves. Their live-and-let-live attitude makes their caravans loud, flashy, and fun. Hill dwarves frequently engage in fist fights to solve minor issues, and would much rather end the day with a black eye than risk making an enemy out of a friend. They don’t harbor grudges and don’t expect that others do so against them; curiously, other dwarves sometimes have trouble trusting hill dwarves because of their willingness to forgive and forget. Characters raised in the hill dwarf culture share a variety of traits in common with one another.
