"YER LATE, ELF! " CAME THE ROUGH EDGE OF A FAMILIAR voice. Bruenor Battlehammer walked up the back of his dead foe, disregarding the fact that the heavy monster lay on top of his elven friend. In spite of the added discomfort, the dwarf's long, pointed, often-broken nose and gray streaked though still-fiery red beard came as a welcome sight to Drizzt. "Knew I'd find ye in trouble if I came out an' lookedforye!"  
-- R. A. Salvatore, The Crystal Shard 

Bold and hardy, dwarves are known as skilled warriors, miners, and workers of stone and metal. Though they stand well under 5 feet tall, dwarves are so broad and compact that they can weigh as much as a human standing nearly two feet taller. Their courage and endurance are also easily a match for any of the larger folk. Dwarven skin ranges from deep brown to a paler hue tinged with red, but the most common shades are light brown or deep tan, like certain tones of earth. Their hair, worn long but in simple styles, is usually black, gray, or brown, though paler dwarves often have red hair. Male dwarves value their beards highly and groom them carefully.

## About
About	One of the Proud People. Gems before gold. Gold before clan. Clan before other dwarves. Dwarves before others. Individual dwarves are determined and loyal, true to their word and decisive in action, and stubborn.

Each mine has a King (ref. Chief Engineer). These kings come together once every 10 years to select the Low King (cfr Chief Executive Engineer) for all dwarves.

Duergar are a clan of slave traders giving other dwarves a bad name. They do not appear different from other dwarves, but have distinct uniforms.

Dwarves get along passably well with most other races. The difference between an acquaintance and a friend is about a hundred years,"" is a dwarf saying that might be hyperbole, but certainly points to how difficult it can be for a member of a short-lived race like humans to earn a dwarf's trust.
