# Human

**Tags:**  #character #lineage 

Human beings are remarkable creatures who, despite their short life span and limited inherent supernatural abilities, produce the noblest heroes and the most vile villains. Human build (and body hair) is somewhere between that of elves and dwarves, yet humans stand taller than either. Their skin and hair color can be dark as jet or light as alabaster. Human hair can also be bright red and pale yellow— other hair colors may be the result of dye, magic, or a distant non-human ancestor like an elf, dragon, or giant. 

The origin of human beings is contentious. Many human cultures believe that their god created humanity. The question of which story and which god is the most true is a source of endless strife. When looking at how short-lived, nonmagical, and vulnerable humans are, one may be hard-pressed to say what exactly makes humans so successful. Some creatures even look down on humans as vermin. The human instinct to survive by the most expedient means available does not help this stereotype — although it helps one to see how such unremarkable creatures persist in mysterious and unforgiving worlds.

## About
Humans were the last lineage to settle on this world and have claimed parts of it as their own and their teritory keeps expanding. Thhis is not taken kindly by those unable to adapt.

Just as readily as they mix with each other, humans mingle with members of other lineages. They get along with almost everyone, though they might not be close to many. Humans serve as ambassadors, diplomats, magistrates, merchants, and functionaries of all kinds.
