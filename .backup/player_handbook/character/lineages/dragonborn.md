# Dragonborn

**Tags:**  #character #lineage 

For all her life, Farideh had known that reading her father's face was a skill she'd been fortunate to learn. A human who couldn't spot the shift of her eyes or Havi/ar's would certainly see only the indifference of a dragon in Clanless Mehen's face. But the shift of scales, the arch of a ridge, the set of his eyes, the gape of his teeth-her father's face spoke volumes. But every scale of it, this time, seemed completely still. The indifference of a dragon, even to Farideh.  
 --Erin M. Evans , The Adversary

Dragonborn look very much like dragons standing erect in humanoid form, though they lack wings or a tail. The first dragonborn had scales of vibrant hues matching the colors of their dragon kin, but generations of interbreeding have created a more uniform appearance. Their small, fine scales are usually brass or bronze in color, sometimes ranging to scarlet, rust, gold, or copper-green. They are tall and strongly built, often standing close to 6V2 feet tall and weighing 300 pounds or more. Their hands and feet are strong, talonlike claws with three fingers and a thumb on each hand. The blood of a particular type of dragon runs very strong through some dragonborn clans. These dragonborn often boast scales that more closely match those of their dragon ancestor-bright red, green, blue, or white, lustrous black, or gleaming metallic gold, silver, brass, copper, or bronze.

## About
To any dragonborn, the clan is more important than life itself. Dragonborn owe their devotion and respect to their clan above all else, even the gods. Each dragonborn's conduct reflects on the honor of his or her clan, and bringing dishonor to the clan can result in expulsion and exile.

Extra "Dragonborn were created by the Elves as a warrior race. The relation of the dragonborn towards elves is highly dependent on their clan.

It can be illegal in some countries or city states to be a Dragonborn.

It's easy to assume that a dragon born is a monster, especially if his or her scales betray a chromatic heritage. Un less the dragon born starts breathing fire and causing destruction, though, people are likely to respond with caution rather than outright fear.
