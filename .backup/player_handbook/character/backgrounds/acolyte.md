You were trained as a servant of a particular god 
or gods. Whether or not you have access to divine 
magic, you are authorized to perform the rites of 
your faith, and you are recognized and respected 
by its faithful.
What gods do you worship? Why did you leave 
the confines of your temple and take up a life of 
adventure? Have you turned your back on your 
faith, or do you seek to advance it?
