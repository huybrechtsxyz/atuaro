## About Lineages
Every character belongs to a lineage, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the D&D world. The most commonly known races are dwarves, elves, hobbits (or halflings), and humans. The race you choose contributes to your character's identity in an important way, by establishing a general appearance and the natural talents gained from culture and ancestry. Your character's race grants particular racial traits, such as special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one or more skills, or the ability to use minor spells. For example, the racial traits of lightfoot halflings make them exceptional rogues, and high elves tend to be powerful wizards. Sometimes playing against type can be fun, too. Half-orc paladins and mountain dwarf wizards, for example, can be unusual but memorable characters. Be sure to note your starting languages and your base speed as well. The following sections appear in the descriptions for most races.

**Age** Details the average age at which a character of this lineage is considered to have reached adulthood, as well as their typical life span. Your character can be of any age, which could also be an opportunity to explain away significantly low or high ability scores.

**Size** All creatures are assigned a size, ranging from Tiny to Gargantuan. Medium and Small are the most common sizes for adventurers.

**Speed** While other factors may influence how fast you are, each lineage has a base Speed. This determines how far you can move on your turn during combat and while traveling.

**Lineage Gift** In addition to the traits granted to all characters of the same lineage, some include multiple gifts for you to choose from to further diversify your character. When multiple options are presented, you may choose only one gift.

**Paragon Gift** Later in their adventuring career, each lineage grants a paragon feature. This could be a completely new feature, or something that improves or offers a new way to use a trait already granted by the heritage.
