## Travelling and Movement
Sometimes it’s important to know how long it takes to get from one spot to another, whether the answer is in days, hours, or minutes. The rules for determining Travel time depend on two factors: the speed and Travel Pace of the creatures moving and the terrain they’re moving over.

### Travel Pace
While traveling, a group of adventurers can move at a normal, fast, or slow pace, as shown on the Travel Pace table. The table states how far the party can move in a period of time and whether the pace has any Effect. A fast pace makes characters less perceptive, while a slow pace makes it possible to sneak around and to Search an area more carefully.

<table>
<tr><th>Pace</th><th>Minute</th><th>Hour</th><th>Day</th><th>Effect</th></tr>
<tr><td>Fast</td><td>400 feet<br />120 meter</td><td>4 miles<br />7 kilometer</td><td>30 miles<br />48 kilometer</td><td>−5 penalty to passive Wisdom (Perception) scores</td></tr>
<tr><td>Normal</td><td>300 feet<br />90 meter</td><td>3 miles<br />5 kilometer</td><td>24 miles<br />38 kilometer</td><td>—</td></tr>
<tr><td>Slow</td><td>200 feet<br />60 meter</td><td>2 miles<br />3 kilometer</td><td>18 miles<br />29 kilometer</td><td>Able to use stealth</td></tr>
</table>

### Forced March
The Travel Pace table assumes that characters Travel for 8 hours in a day. They can push on beyond that limit, at the risk of Exhaustion. For each additional hour of Travel beyond 8 hours, the characters cover the distance shown in the Hour column for their pace, and each character must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of the hour. The DC is 10 + 1 for each hour past 8 hours. On a failed saving throw, a character suffers one level of Exhaustion.

### Difficult Terrain
The Travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains, and ice-covered ground—all considered Difficult Terrain. You move at half speed in difficult terrain— moving 1 foot in Difficult Terrain costs 2 feet of speed—so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an hour, or a day.
