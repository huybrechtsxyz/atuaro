Choose Equipment

In this step, you will select weapons, armor, and other adventuring gear for your character.

Starting Equipment

Your starting equipment options will be displayed on the next screen. Your class and background determine your characterâ€™s starting equipment. Review the options and add the appropriate items using Manage Equipment.

Starting Gold

Instead of taking the gear given to you by your class and background, you can purchase starting equipment. You have a number of gold pieces (gp) to spend based on your class, as shown on the next screen if you choose this option.

Encumbrance

Your Strength score limits the amount of gear you can carry. Try not to purchase equipment with a total weight (in pounds) exceeding your Strength score times 15.
