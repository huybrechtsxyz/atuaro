In this step, you will flesh your character out as a person. By default choose from the list of available backgrounds in this player handbook.

## Making backgrounds
If you want to design your own background, it should include the following: 
* +1 to two ability scores of your choice.
* Proficiency in two skills.
* Proficiency in two tools, two languages, or one of each.
* One connection: an acquaintance, ally, or enemy from your past.
* One memento: an item of sentimental value worth less than 30 gold.
* A background feature describing your relationship with the world. Your background feature typically provides a source of information, shelter, or financial support in a certain lifestyle.

## About Backgrounds
Every story has a beginning. Your character's background reveals where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world. Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester. But most likely your were a peasant. Choosing a background provides you with important story cues about your character's identity. The most important question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background, why don't you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background? 

Although there are no age restrictions to your character, please remember the starting level of your character. This starting level is given in session zero. If your character starts at level 1 and is already a 1000 year old Elf. What did they do in those centuries to only now become an adventurer.

Please talk to your GM about your background. They are willing to help you fit your idea in the world where the story takes place. This will tie your background to the world and fit the character in the game. If you have preconceived ideas about your character, session zero is the place to talk about them. As a general rule we hope that people can create the characters they want, but that players are willing to make concessions to make it work with the world. You can create a custom background.

Some backgrounds gives a character proficiency in skills, tools, additional languages, and most backgrounds provides a package of starting equipment.

## Languages
Your lineage indicates the languages your character can speak by default, and your culture and background might give you access to one or more additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your character sheet. Choose your languages from the Languages table. With your GM's permission, you can instead choose a language from the Exotic or Secret Languages table, such as thieves' cant or the tongue of druids. Creatures that speak different dialects of the same language can communicate with one another. 

For a list of languages and scripts see [Player Languages](./tables/player_languages.md) table.
