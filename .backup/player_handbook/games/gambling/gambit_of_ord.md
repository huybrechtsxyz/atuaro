# Gambit of Ord (Texas Raise Em)

A player can then raise, call or fold a bet. Once all bets are equal, each player will roll an additional 1d6 dice and keep it secret as well.Â 

The betting round restarts and players have a chance to raise, call or fold their bets once again. Then, whoever is left will add another 1d4 die to their rolls and repeat the betting process. Once that is done, whoever is left reveals their dice, and the winner takes 80% of the pot.

Actually, Gambit of Ord is very similar to Hand of Fate, but the difference here is that players test their own luck of the die and do not feature any community dice.
