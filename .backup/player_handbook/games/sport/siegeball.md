Siegeball Rules

 "The lights, the crowd, the trophy; this is where legends are born. The greatest sport ever devised, Siegeball. Two teams, two towers, one ball." -The Audience

[h2]Introduction[/h2]
People in the world need some form of recreational pastime, apart from killing monsters and going on quests, of course. Siegeball is fun, violent, complements all kinds of characters. Siegeball is a game played between two teams of five players each. Each team has a tower to defend from the other team. Players can't attack the towers directly, however. Instead, there is a single ball which can be used to knock down the towers. A team loses when their tower falls.

[h2]The Arena[/h2]
The game is played in a walled rectangular arena. Normally, this arena is 140 feet long by 45 feet wide (28 squares by 9 squares), though arenas of all sizes and shapes exist. Each team's tower, a 5-foot diameter pillar made of wood or loose stone, is set up 10 feet from each end of the arena lengthwise. 

Towers have 25 hit points and can only be damaged by the impact of the ball.

[h2]The Ball[/h2]
Central to the game of Siegeball is the ball, an especially dense sphere of solid rubber or wrapped leather that is pursued by the players. The ball is astoundingly heavy, and players move it by attacking it. Though in some places, players strike the ball with their hands or fists, usually players are given bats (which use the statistics of a club), or even more powerful melee weapons, like warhammers and mauls.

The ball has an AC of 8 and a pool of Momentum Points, which determine how fast it's moving.

When you attack the ball, you can choose to hit it in one of the eight cardinal directions. On a hit, the ball gains a number of momentum points equal to half the damage dealt to it, rounded down. The ball moves five feet in the chosen direction for each momentum point it has. As it moves, the ball subtracts one momentum point for each five feet it moves until it stops.

The ball can collide with walls, objects, or towers.

[ul]
[li]Colliding with a Wall. If the ball collides with a wall, it bounces off at an angle corresponding to its direction and continues to move until it stops.[/li]
[li]Colliding with a Player. If you are not prone, you can use your reaction to hit the ball if it collides with you. To do so, make an attack roll targeting the ball. While moving, the ball has a bonus to its AC equal to its current momentum points. On a hit, roll damage as normal, remove the ball's current momentum points, and send it in a new direction. If you miss, the ball hits you, and you take damage equal to the ball's current momentum points and are knocked prone.[/li]
[li]If you do not use your reaction to stop the ball, it rolls past you.[/li]
[li]Colliding with a Tower. If the ball collides with a tower, it deals damage to the tower equal to the ball's current momentum points and then stops.[/li]

[h2]Playing The Game[/h2]
The game begins with a tip-off in the center of the arena. A player from each team makes an attack roll against the ball. The player with the higher attack roll successfully attacks the ball. Players begin within 10 feet and 30 feet of the ball, but need not begin on their own side.

Players act in initiative order. If preferable, the DM can choose for the teams to take turns acting, instead of keeping track of the players individually. The game ends when a tower is reduced to 0 hp.

Siegeball is a widely-played sport and the exact rules and standards change wherever the game is played. The only concrete rule of Siegeball is not to attack your opponent's tower directly. In most arenas, using magic and attacking players directly are also considered cheating (though this doesn't stop some witches and wizards from influencing the games anyway). However, other behaviors, like shoving opposing players or kicking dirt into their eyes, is tolerated and sometimes even encouraged.

In seedier games, Siegeball is a violent, high-stakes competition. with spellcasters on both sides attempting to secretly fix the game for their side, while the players try to disguise outright attacks on their opponents as legitimate maneuvers. Bets on Siegeball range from a few silver pieces to bags of gold, and games are particularly cut-throat when fortunes are on the line.

[h2]On Your Turn[/h2]
[h3]Standard[/h3]
In addition to attacking (the ball or player), you can
[ul]
[li]Dodge,[/li]
[li]Shove, or[/li]
[li]Dash,[/li]
[/ul]
(and occasionally using an item forbidden by the referees), there are a few special actions that players of a Siegeball game might take.

[h3]Attack a Player (Illegally)[/h3]
In the most disreputable games, direct assaults on other players is not only allowed, it's encouraged. In most games, however, an attack can only be made when the referee isn't looking. When you make an attack on a creature in an arena that doesn't allow direct attacks, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check or a Charisma (Deception) check, contested by the referee's passive Perception score. On a success, you attack the player without consequence. On a failure, you are removed from the game for the following round, and reenter the game on a side of the arena near your tower. Shove actions do not incur a penalty. 

[h3]Block[/h3]
You dig in your heels and hold your ground. You have advantage on any ability check or saving throw you make to resist being moved against your will, and you can use your reaction to attack any ball that moves within 5 feet of you. Additionally, if the ball is within 5 feet of you, other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against it.

[h3]Follow[/h3]
When you take this action, choose a creature you can see within 10 feet of you. When that creature moves, you attempt to follow behind it, moving up to your base speed, while remaining the same distance between yourself and the lead creature for the entire duration of the movement.

[h3]Retire[/h3]
When you take this action, you remove yourself from the field and sit out the rest of the game. This may be useful to free yourself from danger, but you can no longer help your team.

[h3]Tackle[/h3]
Performing a tackle is a special variant of shoving a creature. You have advantage on a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the targetâ€™s Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). On a success, you and the target are knocked prone in the target's space.

Different siegeball arenas impose different restrictions on the games they hold, ranging from so-called underground arenas, where blood is more important than sport, to the mainstream arenas, which are funded by kings or other nobility, and thus impose fairly civilized rules.

[h3]Spellcasting[/h3]
Some spells, specifically those which do not directly deal damage to members of the other team, are allowed. At least one player on each team is encouraged to know the spells dispel magic and counter spell. Attacks against other players and illegal magic are penalized by removing the offending players from the field. The entire team is disqualified if its players are removed from the field three times for breaking the rules, or if one of its players outright kills a member of the other team. Teleporting another player mid-game across the continent, however, is allowed.
