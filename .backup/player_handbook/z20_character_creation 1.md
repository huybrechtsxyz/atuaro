# Character Creation

**Tags:**  #character

To play in a role-playing game you will need a character. But as most players already did this plenty we are going to condense the information in this article to what you need to know to play in Atuaro with links to relevant articles if you want to know more.

## Creating a Character
Your first step in playing an adventure in the game is to imagine and create a character of your own. Your character is a combination of game statistics, role-playing hooks, and your imagination.

You choose a lineage (such as human or dwarf) and a class (such as fighter or wizard). You also invent the personality, appearance, and backstory of your character. Once completed, your character serves as your representative in the game, your avatar in the world.

Before you dive into the character building, think about the kind of adventurer you want to play. You might be a courageous fighter, a skulking rogue, a fervent cleric, or a flamboyant wizard. Or you might be more interested in an unconventional character, such as a brawny rogue who likes hand-to-hand combat, or a sharpshooter who picks off enemies from afar. Do you like fantasy fiction featuring dwarves or elves? Try building a character of one of those lineages. Do you want your character to be the toughest adventurer at the table? Consider a class like barbarian or paladin. Once you have a character in mind, follow the steps in this builder in order, making decisions that reflect the character you want. Your conception of your character might evolve with each choice you make. What's important is that you come to the table with a character you're excited to play.

## Creation Preferences
The next step also includes various preferences for your character. You can proceed with the default options or make changes if desired. Make sure to ask the game master about certain requirements.

## Ability Scores
Much of what your character does in the game depends on his or her six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma. By default we roll 3D6 ONCE for each attribute. Record that score. Proceed in sequence rolling six times (hardcore mode). [Read more](21_character_abilities.md)

## Select a Lineage
Every character belongs to a lineage, one of the many intelligent humanoid species in the D&D world. The most commonly known lineages are dwarves, elves, halfiings, and humans. [Read more](22_character_lineage.md) or see [Playable Lineages](tables/player_lineages.md).

## Select a Culture
The culture you are raised in is as important to your development as the family you are born into. While your chosen culture usually describes how your character grew up, the culture you choose could also represent the environment in which they spent a number of their formative years. [Read more](23_character_culture.md) or see [Playable Cultures](tables/player_cultures.md).

## Select a Background
If a culture tells how a character started, their background helps outline where their journey led. There are a number of backgrounds to choose from each of which provides bonuses to your ability scores, additional proficiencies, and features your character can use while adventuring backgrounds gives a character proficiency in skills, tools, additional languages, and most backgrounds provides a package of starting equipment..

## Select other Characteristic
### Name
Your character's race description includes sample names for members of that race. Put some thought into your name even if you're just picking one from a list. [url:https://www.fantasynamegenerators.com|tab]Fantasy Name Generator[/url] 

### Sex and Gender
You can play a male or female character without gaining any special benefits or hindrances. Think about how your character does or does not conform to the broader culture's expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behavior. For example, a male drow cleric defies the traditional gender divisions of drow society, which could be a reason for your character to leave that society and come to the surface. You don't need to be confined to binary notions of sex and gender. The elf god Corellon Larethian is often seen as androgynous, for example, and some elves in the multiverse are made in Corellon's image. You could also play a female character who presents herself as a man, a man who feels trapped in a female body, or a bearded female dwarf who hates being mistaken for a male. Likewise, your character's sexual orientation is for you to decide. 

### Physical Characteristics
What does your character look like? Define their height, weight, eyes, size, hair, skin, and provide a general description of their appearance. You can decide your character's appearance by using the information provided in your race description. For height and weight check the character's lineage. There is a way to randomize height and weight. Think about what your character's ability scores might say about his or her height and weight. A weak but agile character might be thin. A strong and tough character might be tall or just heavy. The random height and weight dice rolls given in the Height Modifier column determines the character's extra height (in inches) beyond the base height. That same number multiplied by the dice roll or quantity given in the Weight Modifier column determines the character's extra weight (in pounds) beyond the base weight. 

### Religion and Faith
Religion is an indispensable facet of most fantasy worlds, taking imagination into the inner depths of the soul and out into the vast reaches of the multiverse. Like culture and heritage, personal beliefs are a critical part of a character’s identity, and the religious landscape in which they find themself is often riddled with the seeds of adventure. People’s fundamental beliefs, hopes, and fears often drive them to the dire straits which are the stuff of legend. When gods walk the world, clerics channel divine power, evil cults perform dark sacrifices in subterranean lairs, and shining paladins stand like beacons against the darkness, it's hard to be ambivalent about the deities and deny their existence. Many people in Atuaro worship different gods at different times and circumstances (although only one is allowed). People might pray for luck in love, make an offering before heading to the market, and pray when a severe storm blows in-all in the same day.

If you're playing a cleric or a character with the Acolyte background, decide which god your deity serves or served, and consider the deity's suggested domains when selecting your character's domain. If your character has no believe in their patron no powers will be granted?

### Alignment and Morality
A typical creature in the world of Atuaro has an alignment which broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. In the multiverse of Dungeons and Dragons you will find a lot of references to alignment as a combination of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). In Atuaro we only take morality into account. Law and order will follow a different path. If you follow your Code of (dis)honor then you score points, otherwise loose points.

For many thinking creatures, alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other humanoid races can choose whether to follow the paths of good or evil. According to myth, the good-aligned gods who created these races gave them free will to choose their moral paths, knowing that good without free will is slavery. The evil deities who created other races, though, made those races to serve them. Those races have strong inborn tendencies that match the nature of their gods. Most orcs share the violent, savage nature of the ore god, Gruumsh, and are thus inclined toward evil. Even if an ore chooses a good alignment, it struggles against its innate tendencies for its entire life. Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. A devil does not choose to be evil, and it doesn't tend toward evil, but rather it is evil in its essence. If it somehow ceased to be evil, it would cease to be a devil. Most creatures that lack the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments, they are unaligned. Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are not evil; they have no alignment. 

### Personality Characteristics
Fleshing out your character's personality-the array of traits, mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give a person a unique identity-will help you bring him or her to life as you play the game. Four categories of characteristics are presented here: personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those categories, think about your character's favorite words or phrases, tics and habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine.

Give your character two personality traits. Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set your character apart from every other character. Your personality traits should tell you something interesting and fun about your character. They should be self descriptions that are specific about what makes your character stand out. "I'm smart" is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. "I've read every book in Candlekeep" tells you something specific about your character's interests and disposition. Personality traits might describe the things your character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your character dislikes or fears, your character's self attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his or her ability scores.

A useful place to start thinking about personality traits is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and define one trait related to each. Either one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome a low score, for example, or be cocky about your high score. 

### Ideals and Drivers (Motivations)
Describe one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are the things that you believe in most strongly, the fundamental moral and ethical principles that compel you to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core belief system. You can choose any ideals you like, but your character's alignment is a good place to start defining them. Each background in this chapter includes six suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment: law, chaos, good, evil, and neutrality. The last one has more to do with the particular background than with moral or ethical perspectives. 

Ideals answer any of these questions:
* What would you give your life for?
* What are the principles that you will never betray?
* What would prompt you to make sacrifices?
* What drives you to act and guides your goals and ambitions?
* What is the single most important thing you strive for?
 
[h4]Bonds and Connections[/h4]
Create one bond for your character. Bonds represent a character's connections to people, places, and events in the world. They tie you to things from your background. They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against your own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals, driving a character's motivations and goals. Your bonds might be tied to your class, your background, your race, or some other aspect of your character's history or personality. You might also gain new bonds over the course of your adventures. 

Bonds answer any of these questions:
[ul][li]Whom do you care most about?[/li]
[li]To what place do you feel a special connection?[/li]
[li]What is your most treasured possession?[/li][/ul]

[h4]Flaws and Weaknesses[/h4]
Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character's flaw represents some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness-in particular, anything that someone else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your best interests. More significant than negative personality traits.

Flaws  answer any of these questions:
[ul][li]What enrages you?[/li]
[li]What's the one person, concept, or event that you are terrified of?[/li]
[li]What are your vices?[/li]
[li]What would you start a fight over[/li]
[li]What strikes fear into their hart[/li][/ul]
