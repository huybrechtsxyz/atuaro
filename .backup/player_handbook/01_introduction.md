# Introduction

*You sneak through the rocks, noting the hot steam rising from the crevices in the ground, the red glow of the lava just below the surface. Your brow glistens with sweat as you nervously clutch your scimitar. One wrong move, one false step, could mean the end for you. Slowly, carefully, you creep round the corner into a great cavern—and freeze. Before you lies an enormous pile of gold, a treasure hoard like none you’ve ever seen. And curled around it is a winged, scaled serpent with claws the length of swords: a dragon!*

TL;DR This Player Handbook overrules any source book you might think is applicable.

This ROLE-PLAYING game is about storytelling in the world of Atuaro with swords and sorcery. It is driven by imagination. It's about picturing the towering castle beneath the stormy night sky and imagining how a fantasy adventurer might react to the challenges that scene presents. Players roll dice to resolve whether their attacks hit or miss or whether their adventurers can scale a cliff, roll away from the strike of a magical lightning bolt, or pull off some other dangerous task. Anything is possible, but the dice make some outcomes more probable than others.

Our world is a place of magic and monsters, of brave warriors and spectacular adventures. It starts with a medieval fantasy world where we add creatures, places, and magic that make this world unique and part of the vast cosmos called the RPG multiverse, connected in strange and mysterious way via the Astral Sea to the other planes of existence. Atuaro is set apart by its own history and culture, distinctive monsters and races, fantastic geography, ancient dungeons, and scheming villains.
