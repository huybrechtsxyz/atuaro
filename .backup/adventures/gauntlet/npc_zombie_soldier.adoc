*Overpower.* +
Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 3 (1d4 + 1) bludgeoning damage, and the 
target is grappled (escape DC 11).

Melee Weapon Attack: +3 to hit, reach 5 ft., one grappled target. Hit: 6 (2d4 + 1) piercing damage.

| *Abilities* | 

*Rise Again.* +
If a zombie is reduced to 0 hit points by an attack that isn’t a critical hit or doesn’t deal fire or radiant damage, it falls prone and becomes incapacitated, apparently destroyed. At the start of its next turn, it must make a Constitution saving throw (DC 13). If it succeeds, it recovers 1 hit point. Otherwise, it dies. As an action, a character can destroy an incapacitated zombie before it rises again.
