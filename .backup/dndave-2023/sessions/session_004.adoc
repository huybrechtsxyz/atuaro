Gentlemen. What will happen after the carnival? Well I'm glad you asked!
After the carnival you go back to the orphanage and life continues and 10 years will have passed.
What you do in those 10 years is up to you! You get kicked out at 16 as an adult or leave sooner.
After 10 years you are back at the orphanage for <reasons>.

== Rules Discussions

*Half Cover*
A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

*Three-Quarters Cover*
A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.

*Total Cover*
A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.
