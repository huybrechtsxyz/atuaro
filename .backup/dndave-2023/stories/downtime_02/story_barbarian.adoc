In an ill-fated moment, Tyrion committed a grave mistake, taking the life of another in the heat of battle when the fight was already over.

* How does the barbarian 'feel' about the killing?

Tyrion, the barbarian, committed a grave mistake by taking the life of another individual in the heat of battle when the fight was already over. This action has weighed on him? It also limited the number of fights he was able to participate in. During on of his off-nights, he is contacted by a certain Voren Ironhart. Maybe he wants to participate in a more serious league? For the right money?

Voren is a towering figure with the unmistakable features of a half-orc, commands attention wherever he goes. Standing tall and broad-shouldered, his muscular frame speaks of a lifetime spent honing his strength through combat and discipline.

=== Revelations about the Organization
As the barbarian is fighting he uncovers the fact that his current opponent does not want to fight. Unlike the other combatants who size each other up with predatory glares, this figure stands apart, shoulders slumped and gaze averted. His movements are sluggish, lacking the predatory grace of a true fighter, as if each step carries the weight of his unwillingness.

* If the barbarian does not finish the job, Voren will.

Driven by the primal urge to survive and the expectations of the crowd, Tyrion could choose to engage in combat despite his opponent's reluctance. With his muscles tensed and his senses honed, he prepares to clash with a foe who lacks the spirit of a true fighter. Yet, even as he readies himself for battle, a sense of unease gnaws at his conscience, reminding him of the brutality that lurks within the shadows of the ring. He absolutely demolishes the fighter...

=== Rescue Mission
Maybe it too late for the current fight. But does he want to stop the fight ring? The barbarian, driven by the need to redeem himself and save the kidnapped people, leads the party on a daring rescue mission. This could involve infiltrating the organization's hideout, gathering intelligence, and planning the rescue operation. Along the way, the party might encounter other challenges, such as traps, guards, or even rival factions.

=== Confrontation with the luitenant
As the party delves deeper into the organization's activities, they eventually confront the mastermind behind the kidnapping. This could lead to a climactic showdown where the barbarian has a chance to not only save the city guards but also confront his own past actions and seek redemption.

* A serpent coiled around a dagger could represent the organization, symbolizing secrecy, danger, and a hidden threat.
* The half-elf captain he answers to is Captain Seraphina Darkhaert (Bard/Rogue).
