== Plot Summary
After lunch the kids take a short nap in their room. Waking up each player gets a boon depending on how they played. Antonio checked the well: no treasure there. The deal with the pixies and go to the carnival. Then try to get to the treasure map at location 7.  At the moment they only saw the animals, the guards tent, and the entrance. Tyrion (Dave) failed to distract the guard for others to go inside of the tent. Tyrion tries to distract the guard while Antonio tries to look in. Both failed at their attempt. They continue their visit to the carnival. Owlbears and displacer beats. They are put in cages. They found a treasure map and met with a magician with quick hands. Mario was eating a lot of cake and told silly jokes on stage with Antonio. What is the difference between a snowman and snowwoman? Snowballs. 

By Angela. I was called back from my mission to return to Kainga. I do not know why, but the moment I stept inside the Stonehill In I knew. There was Room 4. She had the shown them the light of Ohm. There was no other way. They were searching for a treasure. I had to help them. Antonio got into trouble for something and we had to leave the town. We got lost in the woods. During our night we found a spying goblin. A good moment to reflect.

They notice a lot of blood in the goblins hair, that could not only be his.
The goblin had made drawings of the heroes:
- Tyrion: Power
- Mario: Power
- Antonio: Short
- Angela: Question
- Cornus: Death skull

After their escape from the Death Pith of Whirotepua, Gundren helps them on their way to the Delian Tomb. They killed the partol and are nearing the entrance of the Delian tomb. They rush the entrance guards and can kill them before they can get help. The adventurers go inside the tomb and attack the six goblins in the offering room, hearing the screams of Bess continue to the hall of the Oathkeeper. They kill the shaman before he can really do anything useful and save the girl. They take a long rest in the offering room. Before leaving the tomb, cornus burried the Goblins, and noticed the color of their skull.

They bring back Bess to the village and reunite her with her parents. They use Bess to get a good price with her father (Pasha).Failing to appease them with religion or charm. However they are willing to to give them a discount. Angela uses her religous knowledge in a conversation to Hibiscus. He was caught asking about Cornus, but was able to block any further questioning.

Agreeing to the proposal of Gundren to be his guardsmen on his route to Loukotokia, the depart the next day. After the snake caught them off guard, the horses rear up and Gundren and Antonio fall of the cart. The heroes dispatch of their problems with ease. Tyrion finding and throwing the snake in the bushes, cornus tending to the horses and Angela after Gundren.

== Session Notes

Gundren's Disposition towards the party (Excellent, Good, Okay, Dislike, Bad)? +
    Excellent. (Start of the trip) +
    Good. (They haggle about the price with bess in mind) +
    Okay. (Behaviour of mario) +
    Bad.  (Behaviour of mario) +

They make short work of the dogs. At the nights rest Antonio threathens Gundren and pushes horse manure in his face. Gundren wants to storm of but somehow manages to calm him down enough for him not to do so. They find the the body and examine it. They know some kind of animal sucked the blood out of the lifeless body, but choose not to investigate further. They reach the Silverpine Watch with Gundren still angry and in a bad mood. (Although other try to make it up.)

== Rules Discussions

*Half Cover*
A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

*Three-Quarters Cover*
A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.

*Total Cover*
A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.
