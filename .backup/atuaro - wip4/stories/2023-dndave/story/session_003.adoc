== Plot Summary
After lunch the kids take a short nap in their room. Waking up each player gets a boon depending on how they played. Antonio checked the well: no treasure there. The deal with the pixies and go to the carnival. Then try to get to the treasure map at location 7.  At the moment they only saw the animals, the guards tent, and the entrance. Tyrion (Dave) failed to distract the guard for others to go inside of the tent. Tyrion tries to distract the guard while Antonio tries to look in. Both failed at their attempt.

== Start of session


== Session Notes
On the carnival they discuss what their next step is.
After some discussion they decide to go to the clown

=== At Clown School 
The only one that participate are:
* Cornus. Who fails after being given the 4th Pilon.
* Antonio. Is looking through the tent for the treasury map.

After the juggling game they discuss again and really want that treasury map. (They = Tyrion and Antonio.)
They go back to the guard room.

=== At Guardroom
They concoct a plan where Angela is being kept out of the loop of the treasury map.
* Angela is used as look-out [11 perception]
* Kornus distracts the guards by fake pooping his pant with druid craft
* Mario and Tyrion block the sight to Antonio and fake fight with their wooden swords [Athletics: 19 and 9]
* Antonio first fails a stealth check but then throws 2 natural 20's. So ok then
* Antonio then steals the treasury map

After the map they discuss this without Angela.

=== At the Token Tournament
Without asking what it is about they subscribe to the tournament.
They really want to use the hammer.
* Tyrion tries with all his might and get halfway [7 STR]
* Kornus gets a little higher [8 STR]

The go down to the first room and choose some equipment.

When they enter room #2 they immediately try to figure out a way to kill the clockwork soldiers.
Kornus pushes the table against CS#2 who then activates
Tyrion attacks him but the counter attack of CS#2 knocks him out
In the mean time Antonio tries to tie CS#1 up but fails.
The counter attack of CS#1 takes Antonio out.
Mario and Kornus take out CS#2.

During the attacks Angela gets Ms Witchling involved.
She puts the 2 boys back on their feet and warns them.

=== Carnival Terrain
They take a look at the map (again without Angela, who is scoping out the next stall).
They go to the magic show.

== Post Session
Idea is to finish the carnival, give them an 8 year period to have some backstory.
They gather again at their 16th year at the Orphanage to have their coming of age adventure.

=== Pending Plot Points


=== Future Plot Points


=== Plot Ideas
* Fathers of Angela and Cornus do not like each other? Or Hibiscus sucks up to Pakal.
* Glasstaff is the sad boy
* Nezrra is the bully
* Return of the carnival? After failing the Adventure Tournament, they want revenge.
* Treasury map is a QR code ?

== Rules Discussion

*Half Cover*
A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

*Three-Quarters Cover*
A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.

*Total Cover*
A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.
