*About*

She is a thiefling woman in her early forties, who takes care of the children who are not taken care of by nature. She rules the orphanage with an iron hand, believing that she can save the children from themselves. She is described as old-fashioned and is known to delegate more housekeeping-related tasks to the girls. Despite her strict demeanor, she only cares that the tasks are completed.

    She always speaks in a firm and stern tone
    Constantly checks for cleanliness and order
    Uses a ruler or other implement to enforce her rules
    Quickly walks away from situations or individuals she deems beneath her
    Expects immediate obedience and compliance from those under her care
    Speaks in a condescending manner towards those who do not follow her rules.

*Extra*
Ms. Witchling opened the orphanage after experiencing hardship and loss in her own life. She saw a need for a safe haven for abandoned and orphaned children and wanted to make a difference in their lives. She runs the orphanage with a firm hand, believing that structure and discipline are necessary for the children's development and future success. Despite her strict demeanor, she genuinely cares for the well-being of the children and wants to provide them with a better life than they would have on the streets.

The nearby city of Loukotokia pays Ms. Witchling to take in children from the streets and provide a place for parents to abandon their unwanted children. She accepts this responsibility with a sense of duty and takes pride in helping the children in her care. However, her methods of care and discipline have drawn criticism from some who believe she is too harsh. Nevertheless, she remains steadfast in her belief that her approach is the best way to help the children.

Despite the challenges she faces, Ms. Witchling continues to run the orphanage with a determined spirit, hoping to make a positive impact on the lives of the children in her care.

Mayor Cedric Oakheart of Kainga has a soft spot for Ms. Witchling and often goes out of his way to show her favor. He admires her kindness, wisdom, and unwavering commitment to the children in her care. However, Ms. Witchling is aware of the Mayor's feelings and politely maintains a professional and cordial relationship with him, without encouraging any romantic advances.

Ms. Witchling is well-respected by the townspeople, and despite the Mayor's admiration for her, she remains a fiercely independent and upright member of the community.
