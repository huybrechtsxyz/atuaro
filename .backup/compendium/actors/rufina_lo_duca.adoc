*Common Items*

* Has a single really nice item that they use to accentuate their beauty.

*About*

Believing they are too pretty to work, they might carry items that enhance her appearance, such as a comb. Could also have mannerisms that reflect her confidence and self-importance, such as striking poses, preening in front of mirrors, or tossing their hair. May also pout or throw tantrums when things don't go her way.

    Constantly admiring herself in mirrors or reflective surfaces
    Pouting when she doesn't get her way
    Tossing her hair dramatically
    Striking poses and preening for attention
    Flipping her hair when speaking to others
    Fussing with her clothes and appearance constantly
    Whining or throwing tantrums when things don't go her way.

These mannerisms reflect Lo Duca's confidence and belief that they are too pretty to do any real work, which might make her come across as entitled or vain to others. Will choose the 'nice' jobs to avoid any real work.
