== About the gods of Atuaro

=== Ranginui and Papatuanuku
> In the beginning Ranginui (the sky) and Papatuanuku (earth) were joined together, and their children were born between them in darkness. After they sundered the world in the Age of Dawn, the children decided to separate their parents. To allow light to come into the world. The children then became gods of the world.

=== Ohm
> A youthful deity is competing against all the other gods. Ranginui and Papatuanuku observe the spectacle with a mixture of amusement, shame, and confusion. Ohm, their newest, is unique in that they are only a few thousand years old. Trusted upon them by the new arrivals on Atuaro. Ohm has resulted in upheaval both in the world and in the established traditions and customs of the gods themselves. Ohm glares at the game board, frustrated. "I was winning!". "What went wrong in the last few centuries?" Ohm stares at the board once more, hoping to find an edge ...

Ohm has multiple sainted knights that represents his virtues and powers. Each represents a specific moral ideal.
