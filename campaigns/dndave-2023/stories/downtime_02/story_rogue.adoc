=== Background:
The rogue is framed for stealing the teddybear of the young Mr. Neurdragon junior. At least that is what he is accused of by someone who is spreading rumors. These actions have reached the ear of the their mentor (Magnifico?) and his once-proud mentor is deeply disappointed. He believes in the innocence of the rogue and proposes to steal something really valuable from Mr Neurdragon. He is supposed to have a codex of some sort (~book). It is being whispered that all his riches, power, and knowledge are bound to it.

The mentor (Magnifico, real name is Magnus,) still caring for our rogue, and the orphans in general, despite his (their) flaws, requests that the party help redeem his former apprentice. He can provides information about the rival thieves and the importance of the stolen artifact, emphasizing that returning it could be The Rogue's chance for redemption.
