== Session Notes


=== House Visit
The players then play through the House Visit scenario of the Imbolc Carnival.
The visit went rather quickly, but combat is going fine.
The pixies were underwhelming and to easy.

	They killed all the pixies. Did not question the different way the pixies looked when they were dead or alive.
	 
They followed the one to the attic. The pixie pointed to Gilad and blamed it. No one understood the reference.  There were only spiders on the attic.
Angela would like that Aeria cleaned her mess. But she ignores her.

	Aria is immune voor charm effects.

Angela wanted to tell witchling but Tyrion made sure she did not, not wishing Carnival to go by and them not getting there, because of the treasure map they found.

=== The Carnival
The players then started on the [Carnival](../../../adventures/orphanage/05_house_visit.md) scenario.
Backstory of Angela comes up when she talks to the bisshop.
The first go the beasts and talk to Zepherion. When Cornus wants to free the animals he brushes them aside.
Then try to get to the treasure map at location 7.  Tyrion tries to distract the guard while Antonio tries to look in. Both failed at their attempt.

== Post Session
