2+| *About* +
Is the daughter of the bisshop of the local city. She is a spoiled brat and a teacher's pet. She mostly wants to please her father. She has a connection to her father. But having a daughter with divine powers would be bad for his career. She was raised very religiously from a very young age. Crusader type. The law is never wrong.

== Notes

=== Backstory
In Loukotokia city, Angela, daughter of the bishop, was imbued with a fervent passion for the ways of Ohm. Her father, holding a lofty position, could take great pride in his daughter, and she in turn worshipped him. Soon, she became a devout Custodi, wholly devoted to the church of the one true god Ohm. With little delay, she committed to memory many verses, prayers, and blessings, and like any priest, would recite them with fervour, joining her father in prayer.

One day, when Angela was but eight years of age, her father perceived that her blessings held a greater effect than they ought. It seemed as though the power of Ohm was manifesting through her - a divine touch, an angelic presence. To safeguard his hard-earned position, he took precautions and resolved to send his beloved daughter to a place of safety. And where better than in the stern yet caring arms of Ms. Witchling?

=== After the orphanage

In order to fortify his authority as bishop, Angela's father dispatched his cherished daughter as a missionary to the remote corners of the realm, where primitive tribes still clung to their pagan ways, in need of conversion to the teachings of Ohm. Angela, endowed with a divine touch, was deemed the perfect emissary for the task at hand.

During her time in the wilderness, Angela faced harrowing challenges. She witnessed abhorrent pagan rituals that tested her resolve. However, her faith never wavered, and she returned not as the spoilt child who had left, but as a powerful keeper of the faith, emboldened by her experiences and the tutelage of her mentor Leitbur, a venerable and wise cleric. His guidance had instilled in Angela an even deeper reverence for the divine, and she became a shining example of a true believer..

Drawing upon her unwavering faith in Ohm, she fearlessly preached the gospel, converting many to the righteous path.

A few years passed and Angela was called back home again. Ready for her new assignment, and eager to continue her work in spreading the faith.
