The Martaka is the traditional calendar on Atuaro. Each year has 11 months based on the cycles of the winter moon. These lunar months begin and end when the moon is new, and last for 27 days. The stars also play a part in the calendar. Each month is represented by one or more stars. The calendar starts at the year of reckoning.

Each night of the lunar month has its own name â€“ Mano is the first night, and Ruwiko the last. Depending on the moon, certain days brought good luck for fishing, hunting, planting or harvesting, and other days brought bad luck.

Each day lasts for 21 hours.  Of which depending on the seasons it is dark in winter for 14 hours and in summer for 5. On average you need 6 hours of sleep. A typical day might look like: wake at 4, start work at 5, eat lunch at 9, work until 14, eat dinner at 15, have fun until 19. Go to bed. (Although most played with regular 24 hours.)
