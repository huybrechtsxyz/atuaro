# Character Ability Scores and Skills

**Tags:**  #character, #abilities, #skills  
**Parent**: [Character Creation](20_character_creation.md)  

Much of what your character does in the game depends on his or her six abilities:**Strength**, **Dexterity**, **Constitution**,**Intelligence**, **Wisdom**, and **Charisma**. Each ability has a score, which is a number you record for use during play.

## About Ability Scores
An ability score is not just a measure of innate capabilities, but also encompasses a creature's training and competence in activities related to that ability. Much of what your character does in the game depends on their six abilities. Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming? Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities-a creature's assets as well as weaknesses. Six abilities provide a quick description of every creature's physical and mental characteristics:

**Strength**, measuring physical power. How hard can I hit with this weapon? Represents the physical power your character can exert upon the world.  

**Dexterity**, measuring agility. Can I avoid getting hit by their weapon? Represents your character’s physical agility and reflexes.  

**Constitution**, measuring endurance.  How many strikes from their weapon can I take? Represents your character’s health, stamina, and endurance.  

**Intelligence**, measuring reasoning and memory. Theoretically, I can calculate how many strikes I can take before I pass out. Represents your character’s mental power, including information recall and general knowledge.  

**Wisdom**, measuring perception and insight. It would be best not to test that theory myself in combat. Represents your character’s ability to apply logic and reasoning to situations, as well as overall awareness of surroundings and intuition.  

**Charisma**, measuring force of personality.  I’ve convinced them to just not hit me...or possibly hit someone else. Represents your character’s overall impression on others and their ability to convince, deceive, and lead.

The three main rolls of the game-the ability check, the saving throw, and the attack roll-rely on the six ability scores. The basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20, add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare the total to a target number.

## Determine Ability Scores
Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet. Generate your ability scores by using one of the methods below. This will create your ability scores from which you can calculate the modifier using the table below. A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30. Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5 (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability scores, from 1 to 30. 

After assigning your ability scores using one of the methods below, determine your ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table below. Write the modifier next to each of your scores.

| Score | Modifier | Cost |
| ----- | -------- | ---- |
| 00-01 | -5 |  |
| 02-03 | -4 |  |
| 04-05 | -3 |  |
| 06-07 | -2 | -2 / -1 |
| 08-09 | -1 | 0 / 1 |
| 10-11 |  0 | 2 / 3 |
| 12-13 | +1 | 4 / 5 |
| 14-15 | +2 | 7 / 9 |
| 16-17 | +3 |  |
| 18-19 | +4 |  |
| 20-21 | +5 |  |
| 22-23 | +6 |  |
| 24-25 | +7 |  |
| 26-27 | +8 |  |
| 28-29 | +9 |  |
| 30-+ | +10 |  |
|  |  |  |

### Standard Generation
Ability scores are generated randomly by rolling four 6-sided dice and recording the total of the highest three dice on a spare sheet of paper. You continue to do this until you have a total of six numbers. Choose where you’d like to assign these numbers by recording each next to an ability score.

### Fixed Generation
Works like the Standard Generation method, but the DM asks you to roll the stats in order.

### Standard Array
Instead of rolling dice to determine your six ability scores, you may choose to use the following scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8.

### Point Buy
You are given points by the DM to spend on ability scores, by default 27 points. The cost of each score is shown on the table below (Column Cost). When Point-Buy is an option you can use https://phenixium.com/gameplanpress/ to easily crunch the numbers. The basic Point Buy System gives you 27 points. All Ability Scores start at 8.

### Hardcore Mode
When creating your PC for hardcore mode, it is imperative to employ ‘the honor system.’ No fudging, no going back, no crumpling up the sheet and calling it a mining accident. You’re locked in. For each attribute, roll 3D6 ONCE. Record that score. Proceed thus, in sequence, rolling six times. These are the scores you keep until that character is killed in play. At first, this may seem brutal or ‘too weak,’ but in time you’ll see that this age-old method gives rise to more interesting, emergent stories and play.

## Ability Score Descriptions
### Role Playing Low Rolls
Everyone knows what to do with a 16 STR or 18 DEX, but how to deal with a 6 INT or 7 CON? Be ye doomed? You are a hero of substance! Stand fast! Here are a few ideas to explain your worst stats. Work with the other players and DM. Embracing flaws is a great way to jump start deeper role play. The table below could give you some ideas, at the bottom of the article are descriptions that might give you ideas about low or high ability scores.

| -- | ---- | ----------- |
| 1 | A Grizzled Veteran | You have seen it all, been there, killed that, and barely made it out alive. All the wars and death have taken their toll. What you  suffer in injury, though, you balance with cunning. |
| 2 | The Blight | Recent times have seen a  terrible plague. You’ve survived, but  at a cost. Can it be stopped? |
| 3 | Accursed | Gods-forsaken wizards and their geases! Until this spell is lifted, your affliction will continue. |
| 4 | Animal Kin | By birth or druid meddling, you are part beast. You keep your hood low and your voice down, lest humankind cast you out. |
| 5 | The Kid | You took the adventurer’s road after only ten winters. Your mind may be that of your adult kin, but you are yet small. |
| 6 | Aether Touched | A new kind of metal/ore has been revealed by the mountain dwarves, but this poisons the veins of some, and vexes them with pain. What is its secret? |

## Skills
While abilities provide broad descriptions of a character’s capabilities, a skill represents their training in a particular task such as Acrobatics or Deception. A character who has training in a skill is said to be proficient in it. Most skill proficiencies are acquired by adventurers during character creation from their choice of culture, background, and class.

A single Intimidation check can also be used as part of an interrogation, though further checks rarely offer different results. The Narrator sets the DC of the check based on the target’s bravery and the circumstances of the check; some creatures can’t be intimidated.

A Performance check allows a 
character to entertain an audience with singing,

write or compose music, literature, or other 
artistic endeavors to entertain future audiences. 
The most commonly used ability score is Charisma, 
especially for performances before an audience. 
Writing, composing, or painting might instead

The Narrator sets the DC of the Persuasion check based on what the character is asking for and how the target feels about the character; some persuasion attempts may be impossible. The most commonly used ability score is Charisma. Wisdom might be used for gauging what offers would sway a creature, or Intelligence if it is a matter entirely about logic.

Wisdom is used for sensing alignment and determining whether an action is moral according to a particular philosophy. Charisma can be used for preaching.

**Specialties:** alignment, celestials, cults, fiends, holy symbols, gods, morality, prophecy, undead.

* 18 Hide a dagger† on your person
* 25 Hide a shortsword† on your person

### Stealth 
Stealth is used to hide or avoid notice. A creature’s Stealth check is usually opposed by a potential observer’s Perception check. The most commonly used ability score for Stealth is Dexterity. Constitution might be used for staying still for a very long time, Intelligence for casing out an unfrequented route, and Charisma for blending anonymously into a crowd.

To attempt to hide from a creature, you must be unseen (behind something, obscured, invisible, or otherwise out of sight) and unheard by that creature, as well as undetected by any other special senses that it might possess. Make a Stealth check. This check’s total is used until you stop hiding or are discovered. If a creature sees you while you are hiding or makes a successful Perception check to locate you, or you make a noise that it can overhear, you are discovered and are no longer hidden from that creature. 

**Specialties:** anonymity, camouflage, casing.

**Examples:**
Stealth is almost always contested by the passive Perception of the creature you’re hiding from. The following modifiers are appropriate.
* –2 The hider is wearing distinctive or bright garments
* –2 The area is still and there’s little movement otherwise
* +2 The hider is wearing common or subdued garments
* +2 The area is active and there are distractions

### Survival
The Survival skill allows a character to perform the tasks necessary to thrive in the wilderness: hunting, tracking, avoiding natural hazards, and traveling without letting lost (unlike Nature, a Survival check doesn’t imply knowledge of the trouble you’re avoiding or tracking.) The most commonly used ability score is Wisdom. A character might use Constitution to weather a storm or Intelligence to follow a route marked on an old map.

**Specialties:** dungeoneering, foraging, hunting, tracking, wayfindings

* +2 Soft ground with distinct tracks
* +2 The quarry is in a group of 6 or more

## Unofficial Skills
### Culture
A Culture check allows a character to know the customs, laws, trade in regional products, and etiquette of cultures other than their own (a character is presumed to know about their own culture and background without requiring an ability check.) Culture can also be used to communicate simple concepts with creatures whose language is unknown to a character. The most commonly used ability score is Intelligence. A character might use Wisdom to avoid social blunders, Dexterity to perform an unfamiliar dance, or Charisma to track down a seller of a hard-to-find item.

**Examples:**
* 10 Spot a dangerous structural instability; identify a weak point in a small construction

## Critical Success
When you roll a natural 20 and succeed on an ability check, or when you roll a natural 1 and fail on an ability check, if you’re using a skill roll 1d6 to determine what special effect occurs. Because of the benefits of ability check criticals, some players may try a variety of easy ability checks to get a critical effect. The Narrator is always the arbiter of these critical effects and can rule that if an ability check is superfluous or insignificant, any resulting natural 20s and natural 1s have no special effect. 

Tool Kits. Whether or not a tool kit is appropriate for an Ability Check Critical and for which type it qualifies is at the Narrator’s discretion

## Varia and Bruenor
We roll the stats for both of them and determine our ability scores.
