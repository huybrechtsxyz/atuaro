## Advancement Type
Typically, your character begins play at 1st level. Adjust your level if youâ€™re playing in a higher-powered campaign. As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he or she gains experience, represented by Experience Points (XP). Once you reach a specified XP total, you gain a new level. Adjusting your character level will change your XP total and vice versa. Alternatively you use milestone leveling and gain new levels on story beats and campaign progress. Starting level and gaining levels is discussed at session zero.
