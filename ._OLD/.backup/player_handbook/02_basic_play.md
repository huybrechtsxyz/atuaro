# About playing a RPG

**Tags:** #basics

## TL;DR
The GM (game master) describes the scene, you respond and throw some dice, the GM narrates the outcome. You now know how to play an RPG, go have fun! The different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, dl0, dl2, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die.

## Objectives and Achievements
Like most games, the main goal is for everyone to have fun. However, unlike competitive games, the goal isn’t to win. It isn’t a race to see who reaches the highest level first, or a contest to find out whose character is the best, or a challenge to kill the most mobs and bosses. It isn’t a player versus player or even player versus environment type of game. It’s a “let’s have an adventure and see what happens” kind of game.

That said, there are challenges and levels —and yes, even epic boss fights. The players have plenty of objectives to accomplish and achievements to earn. But the journey it takes to reach those goals is just as important as the goals themselves. 

## Roles and Responsibilities
There are two broad roles for gamers to take up. **One person acts as the DM or GM** (or Narrator, Game Master, Dungeon Master) and the rest of the group are the individual **adventurers** (more simply referred to as players). **The GM is responsible for setting play in motion by describing the game world**, introducing dynamic scenarios, and providing meaningful options to the players. The GM is also responsible for populating the world with all manner of peoples and creatures with which to interact. Players create player characters (PCs) that interact with the game. They construct a backstory that serves to motivate their PC and inform their current and future decisions. In so doing, players are also contributing to the living lore of the game world. 

While PCs are certainly central to the narrative, they aren’t the only characters in the game. **As the players are responsible for role-playing and rolling dice for their PCs**, the GM plays as and rolls for all the non-player characters (NPCs). Much of the play in GM is narrative in nature, where players and the GM narrate or describe what is going on in the game world.  However, many of the outcomes may be determined by rolling dice. Based on the game rules, the objectives of the current encounter, and the intended PC actions described by players, the GM arbitrates when a roll is needed.

**The GM is not your opponent but a neutral referee to world and its mechanics.**

## Adventure Awaits
The game consists of a group of characters embarking on an adventure that the GM presents to them. Each character brings particular capabilities to the adventure in the form of ability scores and skills, class features, racial traits, equipment, and magic items. Every character is different, with various strengths and weaknesses, so the best party of adventurers is one in which the characters complement each other and cover the weaknesses of their companions.

**The adventurers must cooperate to successfully complete the adventure.** The adventure is the heart of the game, a story with a beginning, a middle, and an end. An adventure might be created by the GM or purchased off the shelf, tweaked and modified to suit the DM's needs and desires. In either case, an adventure features a fantastic setting, whether it's an underground dungeon, a crumbling castle, a stretch of wilderness, or a bustling city.

It features a rich cast of characters: the adventurers created and played by the other players at the table, as well as non-player characters (NPCs). Those characters might be patrons, allies, enemies, hirelings, or just background extras in an adventure. Often, one of the NPCs is a villain whose agenda drives much of an adventure's action. Over the course of their adventures, the characters are confronted by a variety of creatures, objects, and situations that they must deal with in some way. Sometimes the adventurers and other creatures do their best to kill or capture each other in combat. At other times, the adventurers talk to another creature (or even a magical object) with a goal in mind. And often, the adventurers spend time trying to solve a puzzle, bypass an obstacle, find something hidden, or unravel the current situation. Meanwhile, the adventurers explore the world, making decisions about which way to travel and what they'll try to do next. 

Adventures vary in length and complexity. A short adventure might present only a few challenges, and it might take no more than a single game session to complete. A long adventure can involve hundreds of combats, interactions, and other challenges, and take dozens of sessions to play through, stretching over weeks or months of real time. Usually, the end of an adventure is marked by the adventurers heading back to civilization to rest and enjoy the spoils of their labors. A single game session typically lasts 3 to 4 hours, though some may run under 2 hours or upwards of 8. As long as all the players are available and still having fun, game time isn’t really set in stone.

But that's not the end of the story. You can think of an adventure as a single episode of a TV series, made up of multiple exciting scenes. A campaign is the whole series-a string of adventures joined together, with a consistent group of adventurers following the narrative from start to finish. A session might be one episode while a campaign might be a whole season, the adventures are the story arcs.

## The Three Pillars of Adventure
Adventurers can try to do anything their players can imagine, but it can be helpful to talk about their activities in three broad categories: exploration, social interaction, and combat. 

### Exploration
Exploration ncludes both the adventurers' movement through the world and their interaction with objects and situations that require their attention. Exploration is the give-and-take of the players describing what they want their characters to do, and the GM telling the players what happens as a result. On a large scale, that might involve the characters spending a day crossing a rolling plain or an hour making their way through caverns underground. On the smallest scale, it could mean one character pulling a lever in a dungeon room to see what happens.

### Social interaction
Social interaction features the adventurers talking to someone (or something) else. It might mean demanding hat a captured scout reveal the secret entrance to the goblin lair, getting information from a rescued prisoner, pleading for mercy from an ore chieftain, or persuading a talkative magic mirror to show a distant location to the adventurers. The rules support exploration and social interaction, as do many class features and personality traits. 

### Combat
Combat involves characters and other creatures swinging weapons, casting spells, maneuvering for position, and so on-all in an effort to defeat their opponents, whether that means killing every enemy, taking captives, or forcing a rout. Combat is the most structured element of a D&D session, with creatures taking turns to make sure that everyone gets a chance to act. Even in the context of a pitched battle, there's still plenty of opportunity for adventurers to attempt wacky stunts like surfing down a flight of stairs on a shield, to examine the environment (perhaps by pulling a mysterious lever), and to interact with other creatures, including allies, enemies, and neutral parties.

## The Game Components
### Epic Combat
Combat requires thought and tactic. Opponents are intelligent, ruthless, and know how to use their environment. Usually these fights take up a large part of the session.

### Tactical Thinking
Maybe try to skip this combat by smart thinking, use evasion, escape, and stealth. Find the McGuffin by silently killing the guard and sneaking out the backdoor.

### Heroes
Your character is a hero by default. They save innocent people, overthrow dictators, and destroy evil. And that is just Tuesday. In most adventures you are the noble knight in shining armor. There are campaigns and adventures where your are just a regular Joe or in some cases the true villain.

### Mystery and story
Events happen and a story unfolds. Sometimes the events are a mystery for a team of Poirot to solve.

### Moral Dilemmas
There might not be a simple solution. All solutions are bad. Be Batman. Choose who you save. The king or the beauty.

### Role-play
Not everything is combat. Talk to the guard. Maybe he hates the evil bad guy too? Negotiate with the barkeep.

### Villains
The ones that are trying to overthrow order and fill the world with chaos. They have dreams and aspirations. Don't let them escape. The will remember who gave them that scar.

### Plot twists
Just when you think to know how what the story, world, NPC is about you seem to be wrong. Something changed. Some pieces of the puzzle do not seem to fit.

### Dungeon crawling
Your get in, kill the monsters, loot the treasure, save the girl. All in one convenient place. Awesome right?

## Imaginative Play
Creating a fictional character, identifying their strengths and weaknesses, imagining their backstory, deciding on a personality, and then assuming the persona of that character may seem more like steps for practicing method acting than for playing a game. But it’s really much less daunting than it sounds. Most if not all people have already engaged in spontaneous yet incredibly detailed imaginative play at some point in their lives. If you’ve ever seen a six-year-old running around with a towel for a cape or flopping around in their parents’ shoes and telling their siblings to eat their vegetables, you’ve witnessed true role-play masters perfecting their craft. So if you’re worried about whether you’re going to be good at role play or not, there’s really no need to be nervous. You’ve got this! Not everyone has to be a professional actor to play and have fun.

While role-playing can be done in first person (“I swing my axe to the ready as I face the oncoming threat!”), it is just as valid to narrate in the third person (“Tho’dak attempts to evade detection by slipping into the shadows and remaining perfectly still…”). Even simply describing what you want to happen (“I’m hoping my character can convince the Duke to let the other party members out of jail.”) provides the perfect amount of detail for the other players to respond to. Different players will naturally gravitate towards different modes of play.

Some players will take to role-playing like they were born to the stage. For others, the challenge of finding creative or tactical ways for their characters to overcome obstacles is their go-to mode of play. Some find that the wonder of discovery— the new worlds, the intriguing mysteries, and the colorful characters — are what bring them back to the table time and again. While one mode of play may be favored over another, most players do engage with and enjoy multiple modes at the same time.

**Stay in character. Make sure we know who's speaking - you the player or you the character.**

## How To Play
The play of the game unfolds according to this basic pattern. 

1. The GM describes the environment. The GM tells the players where their adventurers are and what's around them, presenting the basic scope of options that present themselves (how many doors lead out of a room, what's on a table, who's in the tavern, and so on).

2. The players describe what they want to do. Sometimes one player speaks for the whole party, saying, "We'll take the east door," for example. Other times, different adventurers do different things: one adventurer might search a treasure chest while a second examines an esoteric symbol engraved on a wall and a third keeps watch for monsters. The players don't need to take turns, but the GM listens to every player and decides how to resolve those actions. Sometimes, resolving a task is easy. If an adventurer wants to walk across a room and open a door, the GM might just say that the door opens and describe what lies beyond. But the door might be locked, the floor might hide a deadly trap, or some other circumstance might make it challenging for an adventurer to complete a task. In those cases, the GM decides what happens, often relying on the roll of a die to determine the results of an action.

3. The GM narrates the results of the adventurers' actions. Describing the results often leads to another decision point, which brings the flow of the game right back to step 1.  This pattern holds whether the adventurers are cautiously exploring a ruin, talking to a devious prince, or locked in mortal combat against a mighty dragon. In certain situations, particularly combat, the action is more structured and the players (and DM) do take turns choosing and resolving actions. But most of the time, play is fluid and flexible, adapting to the circumstances of the adventure. Often the action of an adventure takes place in the imagination of the players and DM, relying on the DM's verbal descriptions to set the scene. Some DMs like to use music, art, or recorded sound effects to help set the mood, and many players and DMs alike adopt different voices for the various adventurers, monsters, and other characters they play in the game. Sometimes, a GM might lay out a map and use tokens or miniature figures to represent each creature involved in a scene to help the players keep track of where everyone is.

## Tiers of Play
The tiers of play don't have any rules associated with them; they are a general description of how the play experience changes as characters gain levels. 

In the first tier (levels 1-4), characters are effectively apprentice adventurers. They are learning the features that define them as members of particular classes, including the major choices that flavor their class features as they advance (such as a wizard's Arcane Tradition or a fighter's Martial Archetype). The threats they face are relatively minor, usually posing a danger to local farmsteads or villages. 

In the second tier (levels 5-10), characters come into their own. Many spellcasters gain access to 3rd-level spells at the start of this tier, crossing a new threshold of magical power with spells such as fireball and lightning bolt. At this tier, many weapon-using classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks in one round. These characters have become important, facing dangers that threaten cities and kingdoms. 

In the third tier (levels 1 1-16), characters have reached a level of power that sets them high above the ordinary populace and makes them special even among adventurers. At 11th level, many spellcasters gain access to 6th-level spells, some of which create effects previously impossible for player characters to achieve. Other characters gain features that allow them to make more attacks or do more impressive things with those attacks. These mighty adventurers often confront threats to whole regions and continents. 

At the fourth tier (levels 17-20), characters achieve the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic (or villainous) archetypes in their own right. The fate of the world or even the fundamental order of the multiverse might hang in the balance during their adventures.

## Throwing Dice
The game uses different polyhedral dice. The different dice are referred to by the letter d followed by the number of sides: d4, d6, d8, dl0, dl2, and d20. For instance, a d6 is a six-sided die (the typical cube that many games use). Percentile dice, or d100, work a little differently. You generate a number between 1 and 100 by rolling two different ten-sided dice numbered from 0 to 9. One die (designated before you roll) gives the tens digit, and the other gives the ones digit. If you roll a 7 and a 1, for example, the number rolled is 71. Two Os represent 100. Some ten-sided dice are numbered in tens (00, 10, 20, and so on), making it easier to distinguish the tens digit from the ones digit. In this case, a roll of 70 and 1 is 71, and 00 and 0 is 100. 

When you need to roll dice, the rules tell you how many dice to roll of a certain type, as well as what modifiers to add. For example, "3d8 + 5" means you roll three eight-sided dice, add them together, and add 5 to the total. The same d-notation appears in the expressions "ld3" and "ld2." To simulate the roll of ld3, roll a d6 and divide the number rolled by 2 (round up). To simulate the roll of ld2, roll a d6 and assign a 1 to an odd roll and 2 to even.

Does an adventurer's sword swing hurt a dragon or just bounce off its iron-hard scales? Will the ogre believe an outrageous bluff? Can a character swim across a raging river? Can a character avoid the main blast of a fireball, or does he or she take full damage from the blaze? In cases where the outcome of an action is uncertain, the game relies on rolls of a 20-sided die, a d20, to determine success or failure.

Every character and monster in the game has capabilities defined by six ability scores. The abilities are Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, and they range from 6 to 18 for most adventurers. Monsters might have scores as low as 1 or as high as 30. These ability scores, and the ability modifiers derived from them, are the basis for almost every d20 roll that a player makes on a character's or monster's behalf.

Ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws are the three main kinds of d20 rolls, forming the core of the rules of the game. All three follow these simple steps. 

1. Roll the die and add a modifier. Roll a d20 and add the relevant modifier. This is typically the modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and it sometimes includes a proficiency bonus to reflect a character's particular skill.

2. Apply circumstantial bonuses and penalties. A class feature, a spell, a particular circumstance, or some other effect might give a bonus or penalty to the check. 

3. Compare the total to a target number. **If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success.** Otherwise, it's a failure. The GM is usually the one who determines target numbers and tells players whether their ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws succeed or fail. The target number for an ability check or a saving throw is called a Difficulty Class (DC).

The target number for an attack roll is called an Armor Class (AC). This simple rule governs the resolution of most tasks in play.
