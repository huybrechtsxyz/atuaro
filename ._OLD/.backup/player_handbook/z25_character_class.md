Choose a Class

In the next step, choose a class for your character. Every adventurer is a member of a class. Class broadly describes a character's vocation, what special talents he or she possesses, and the tactics he or she is most likely to employ when exploring a dungeon, fighting monsters, or engaging in a tense negotiation.

Your character receives a number of benefits from your choice of class. Many of these benefits are class features - capabilities (including spellcasting) that set your character apart from members of other classes. You also gain a number of proficiencies: armor, weapons, skills, saving throws, and sometimes tools. Your proficiencies define many of the things your character can do particularly well, from using certain weapons to telling a convincing lie.

Multiclassing

Adventurers sometimes advance in more than one class. A rogue might switch direction in life and swear the oath of a paladin, A barbarian might discover latent magical ability and dabble in the sorcerer class while continuing to advance as a barbarian. Elves are known to combine martial mastery with magical training and advance as fighters and wizards simultaneously.

The optional rules for combining classes in this way is called Multiclassing.

[h2]Adventuring Class[/h2]
Every adventurer is a member of a class. Being an adventurer is more than just an occupation. Your character has a spark somewhere deep inside their soul that places their feet on the path too dangerous for others to tread. Perhaps it was simply survival at first, or a quest for gold or honor, or maybe they answered a higher calling from a being far more powerful than they. But whatever its origin, it is the crucial element that separates the rogue from the simple pickpocket and the warlord from the common soldier.
