# Sinner Spinner

Offering a small buy-in, which is always adjustable anyway, players compete to guess either the exact number of a single d20 rolled by the dealer or to guess whether the result would be odd or even.

Once the dealer has rolled, all bets are settled. A player who has guessed the exact number wins triple the original amount they have staked, and anyone who guesses the odd or even outcome will get a 1.5 payout. Loser bets are contributed to the casinoâ€™s pot.
