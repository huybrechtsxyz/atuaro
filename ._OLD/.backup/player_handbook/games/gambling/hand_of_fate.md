# Hand of Fate (Texas Hold Em)

Played similarly to Texas Hold ’em casino poker, this D&D gambling game has its own flop, turn, and river. The premise of **Hand of Fate** is very simple. Each participating player pays 50 GP to join the pot, although bets may be adjusted based on group preferences.

Then, a player rolls 1d12 die and keeps it secret from his or her fellow players. Each player can then choose to fold and forfeit their bet, call the bet or raise the bet if they feel confident in their roll. After that, a 1d12 die is rolled that becomes a community dice that everyone can see.

After the roll, players can again call, raise or fold their bets as they see fit. Once this round is finished, another 1d12 die is rolled, so players now have two community dice. This is the part where players have a final chance to adjust their bets before they have to reveal their own dice.

The winning condition is simple. The player with the highest combined value of his or her own die and the community dice wins 80% of the pot, and the other 20% is contributed to the casino.
