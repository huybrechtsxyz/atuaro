# Liar's Dice

All participating players will roll 5d6 dice and keep their roll hidden from the prying eyes of their fellow travelers. Now, this is where it gets interesting. Each turn, a player gets to bid on a face value, and the number equal to the number of dice showing that face value. 

Now, when a player’s turn comes after another, they can either challenge the previous player’s bid or make an even higher bid. If you want to raise a bid, you should go higher in terms of dice quantity or face value, or even both if you think you know something that your fellow players.

Once a bid is challenged, all dice are revealed. The winning condition is sorted out by whoever guessed correctly. If the bid is true, the bidder wins, but if the bid is false, then the challenger wins, and the bidder is eliminated.
