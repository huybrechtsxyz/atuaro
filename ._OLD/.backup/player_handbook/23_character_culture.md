## Making Cultures
If you want to design your own culture, it can include the following:
- Proficiency in one skill and/or tool and/or weapon.
- Proficiency in at least the culture's language.
- A cultural feature that describes your relationship with the world. These typically also provide a source of information, shelter, support for that culture.

## About cultures
The culture you are raised in is as important to your development as the family you are born into. While your chosen culture usually describes how your character grew up, the culture you choose could also represent the environment in which they spent a number of their formative years.

The culture you choose grants traits that have been learned, trained, or otherwise developed over time. For example, shadow elves lead very different lives from high elves, who live different lives from their wood elf counterparts. You can choose any culture, even one usually associated with another culture. When choosing a culture that is dramatically different from your culture, you should always ask why, in order to further develop your characterâ€™s origin story. You can choose only one culture during this step.

Some cultures are commonly associated with certain lineages. There are forest gnome and wood elf communities which may share a geographical root, but are manifestly different in social structure, custom, or tradition. Similarly, deep dwarf and deep gnome communities are very different. A human who grew up in a forest might come from a wildling village, or have been brought up in a wood elf tree-town or a secretive forest gnome enclave. Dwarves can be adopted by elvish communities, and gnomes can live their entire lives in grand cosmopolitan cities. While lineages have suggested cultures, this should not be viewed as a rule or limitation, but merely as an indication that particular combinations are common.

Each culture contains a range of optional traits that the DM can allow.
