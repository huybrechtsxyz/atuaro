# The Rules of the Game

**Tags:** #rules, #basics

## TL;DR
The Atuaro Player Handbook [APHB] overrules any source book you might think is applicable. By default only information from this book is usable. The core rules of Dungeons and Dragons are used (even if not mentioned) unless specifically overruled in this book.

## Basic Game Mechanics
This game is based on Dungeons and Dragons 5E. When no rules are available in this APHB then please refer to the standard D&D 5E rule books.

## Specific rules beats general ones
This book contains rules that govern how the game plays. That said, many racial traits, class features, spells, magic items, monster abilities, and other game elements break the general rules in some way, creating an exception to how the rest of the game works. Remember this: If a specific rule contradicts a general rule, the specific rule wins. 

Exceptions to the rules are often minor. For instance, many adventurers don't have proficiency with longbows, but e.g, every elfcould  because of a racial trait. That trait creates a minor exception in the game. Other examples of rule-breaking are more conspicuous. For instance, an adventurer can't normally pass through walls, but some spells make that possible. Magic accounts for most of the major exceptions to the rules.

## Throwing Dice
Compare the total to a target number. **If the total equals or exceeds the target number, the ability check, attack roll, or saving throw is a success.** Otherwise, it's a failure. **Throw dice onto the table or a dice tray with intent and don't pre-roll.** If a die rolls on the floor, re-roll it. If a dice is cocked, re-roll it. You do not roll your dice unless you are asked. Describe your character’s actions. If the DM thinks, yea well… they will ask for an ability check, saving throw, attack roll, or even a plain 1d20 and decide upon a DC. (Exception is basic combat.)

But ...I?
* If you roll before required, you will need to re-roll, for better or worse.
* After seeing a bad roll, you roll while saying ‘# Me Too’. You get disqualified from the roll.
* If you request to roll AND have a good motivation to do so, the DM might permit you or others to roll (with perhaps a restriction, like only those proficient in skill x can).
* Please remember that you can aid (Help) another character in a role. This is announced before a dice is rolled! Otherwise aid is not given. Beat a DC10 by default to help. DM can set another DC.

Players are accustomed to rolling an attack roll first and then a damage roll. If players make attack rolls and damage rolls at the same time, the action moves a little faster around the table.

## Round Down
There's one more general rule you need to know at the outset. Whenever you divide a number in the game, round down if you end up with a fraction, even if the fraction is one-half or greater. Dividing 3 by 2 means the result is 1.5, rounded down to 1.

## Hit Points
Depending on the style of the game your hit points might deviate from the standard.

### Hardcore Mode
* Hit Points are thrown using the Hit Die without the CON modifier.
* You are DEATH at lower then zero hit points. On zero hit points you are unconscious.

## Temporary Hit Points
Temporary hit points aren't cumulative. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you don't add them together, unless a game feature says you can. Instead, you decide which temporary hit points to keep.
