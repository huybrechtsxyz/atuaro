# The Rules of Combat

## Reaction Timing
Certain game features let you take a special action, called a reaction, in response to an event. Making opportunity attacks and casting the shield spell are two typical uses of reactions. If you're unsure when a reaction occurs in relation to its trigger, here's the rule: **the reaction happens after its trigger, unless the description of the reaction explicitly says otherwise**. Once you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. 

## Half, Three-Quarters, and Full Cover
Half Cover
A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.

Three-Quarters Cover
A target with three-quarters cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.

Total Cover
A target with total cover can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle. 

## Critical Hit and Fumble
Critical hits and fumbles happen when you roll a natural 20 or 1 on a 20-sided die. This means you rolled a 1 or 20 without any modifiers like your attack mod (but rolling a natural 20 with advantage counts). There is a separate table for weapons and spells.

## Combat Zones
In some scenarios the DM might declare a room a ZONE. That means everything in that zone can freely attack without movement. Going from ZONE to ZONE then uses movement and triggers reaction. Anything in that zone is considered melee combat.
