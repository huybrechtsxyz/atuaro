== Summary

Our heroes return after 10 years to Kainga and notice that things are changed. The orphanage burned down and there is no sight of Ms Witchling or the offspring. Recently, there has been an in influx of goblins in the region and some of the foul creatures have even begun attacking the farms in the outskirts of the village of Kainga.

== To Do List

. Create an introduction chapter that explains what is going on in this adventure.
. Create a treasury map puzzle
. What if they skip the patrol? Does it trigger an attack if the team rests in the tomb?
. Make the silverpine road a more encouter based system with rounds
. Rework the body on the road to silverpine watch. It was unusable.

== Welcome Back

Welcome back to Kainga, now save the blacksmith's daughter or figure out the treasury map.

=== On the road

> As you make your way through the winding path that leads to the village, you find yourself surrounded by tall trees on either side. The dense branches overhead form a canopy that blocks out much of the sunlight, casting shadows across the forest floor. The ground beneath your feet is soft and silent, covered in a layer of leaves and moss. As you move deeper through the woods, the air grows cooler, and the sounds of the outside world fade away. The only sounds you can hear are the rustling of leaves and the occasional chirping of birds. The path itself is wide enough to support wagons and horses, but it's twisting and winding, and it's easy to get lost if you stray too far from it. 

Each player (or group of players) walk through the forest and have an event. Roll 2d6.

*Old Lady* +
Rosie Beestinger is a halfling, which means she is short in stature, standing at about 3-4 feet tall. She has tan skin and dark hair that is usually styled in a pixie cut. Her hair is often adorned with various baubles and trinkets that reflect her fun-loving and adventurous personality. Rosie has bright green eyes that sparkle with mischief, and she often wears a sly smirk on her face.

=== Stonehill Inn
> As you approach the village, the trees start to thin out, and you can see patches of farmland and grazing animals in the distance. The path becomes wider and more defined. You emerge from the woods and see the village in front of you, nestled in a valley with the surrounding countryside in the background. You make your way to the village and the Inn.
> 
> 10 years have passed when you return to Kainga. In the center of the town stands a large roadhouse of field stone and rough-hew timbers. Dusk falls and several people come to the Stonehill Inn for food, warmth, and a place to rest. The common room is filled with locals nursing their mugs of ale, wine, or cider. All of them eyeing you with curiosity. One day is much the same as another in this outcrop of civilization. But, looking at you, something tells these people something will be different today. You seat yourself at one of the tables.

The proprietor is a short, friendly young human male named *Toblen Stonehill*. Toblen is a native of the town to the east. He came to Kainga to chop wood, but soon realized that he knew a lot more about running an inn than he did about wood. He has his wife and children.

The characters' other alternative for lodging is to camp outside the town, or to persuade a farmer such as Daran Edermath or Qelline Alderleaf to let them sleep in a hayloft.

*Let the characters meet each other after the 10 years absence.* +
Describe in-character what they did as profession. + 
How they look. +

> A man is approaching the table. He has a spring in his step and has short hair parted on one side styled in a somewhat messy styled fashion. He has gruff beard. He seems purposeful and confident in the way he walks. 
> Hi. I'm Mat. Can I get you anything to drink? to eat?
> Not many rat catchers coming through Kainga these days.

After taking orders he asks casual:
> Where are you from? Where are you going?

Give them a chance to interact with Matt. He is then off fixing whatever the PCs have ordered, and the characters have had a chance to get to know each other and the NPCs. Now something has to happen...

Either they have a treasury map you can use this hook.
Otherwise the goblins will kidnap the blacksmith's daughter.

=== The inciting incident
_If the adventurers have a treasury map follow The Treasury Map, otherwise follow the alternative The Backsmith's Daughter path._

==== A. The Treasury Map 
The players think they have found out about the treasury map during some drinks and deside to go about to find the treasure.

==== B. The Blacksmith's Daughter 
> A large man, wearing a black leather apron over linen shirt and woollen pants bursts in the door. He smells of sulfur and carries a heavy hammer.
> "They got Bess", he says, "they got my girl!"

Goblins have kidnapped the Blacksmith's daughter!

The characters know about Pasha Lebedev but lost contact with him during their years out of town. He is now the towns blacksmith. The villagers all know Pasha, he's well-loved hard working man, but none of them are equipped to face the challenge of hunting down goblins.

Pasha will recognize the band of rat catchers as quickly as anyone, and he won't hesitate to approach his earlier friends to ask for their help. If your players aren't motivated, simply by their sense of justice and duty, you can have Lars point out that their is a standing bounty for goblin ears by order of the mayor. Pasha married Rufina and have a daughter named Bess.

_Pasha_ 
> I do not know where they took her. As he walks the towns dirt road back to his smithy he pleads for your help. 

_DM_ 
> "What do you do?". 

Pasha doesn't know where the goblins took his daughter, but he's confident that a competent adventurer can find tracks in the area around his house. While Lars can offer this information to the players if they seem to be feeling stuck, you should give them the chance to propose searching the crime scene on their own. You can simply narrate the journey from the Stonehill Inn to the' Smithy, describing the dirt road and the trees that dot the path. 
 
You can even have Pasha nudge them and ask, "do you see any tracks?". Here is your first opportunity to ask the player searching for tracks to make a Ability Check.

* The tracks are plentiful, and easy to spot.
* DC 10 Wisdom (Survival) check recognizes that at least two goblins dragged something north, into the forest. It was resisting.

=== The Woods

==== A. Treasury map
> As you make your way into the dense forest trying to keep the map synchronized with the path. The map depicts the forest, showing various landmarks and obstacles in the area. The darkness has become too great to navigate or see in the forest any further. You find a small clearing and set up camp.

==== B. Blacksmith's Daughter
> You travel deep into the woods, tracking the trail left by the goblins long in the night. The darkness has become too great to navigate or see in the forest any further. You find a small clearing and set up camp.

The woods are a large expanse of forest. The locals hunt here frequently, and it is free of goblins. If the goblins went this way, they must have a hideout somewhere. The journey to the other side of the forest is going to take a bit longer than what they can cover in a single day, the adventurers will be required to spend the night. This is a great opportunity to remind the players that the wilderness is a dangerous place, your goal here is to make the players take watch in middle of the forest and feel wary, wondering if something is going to attack them in the middle of the night!

*Skill Challenge [DC10]!* +
_Treasury Map_: How are they making sure to read the map right and follow the tracks through the woods?

_Blacksmith's Daughter_: How are they tracking the goblins through the forest?

* Only skills you have proficiency in
* You can only use a skill once
* 3 Successes for 3 failures

*Random Encounter [1D12]* +

* If the player rolls a 9 or 10 a boar comes to investigate the camp (non combat unless they attack it) 
* If the player rolls a 11 or 12 then a goblin is spying on them. If they see it, they can attack it as it is stuk in a tree. He will not spill the beans, but does mention how tasty humans are.

>
>As he notices your presence, he looks up, points his finger at you and says "Can't wait to become Whirotepua's followers, do you? Come, let me reward your enthusiasm!"

== The Delian Tomb

image::{homedir}/assets/maps/gauntlet_tomb.png[align=center]

=== Area 1 - Goblin Patrol
>Just beyond the reach of the woods a clearing stretches out before low sprawling hills. In the distance the stonework of a tomb is just barely visible between the sparse trees and rolling hills. You briefly spot a small form moving about the hilltop ahead of you.

> DM: "Are you trying to avoid being seen?"

*Stealth?* +
Roll a Dexterity (Stealth) Ability Check against DC 12. +
Success: they see the goblins and can surprise them. +
Failure: standard combat encounter.

*Standard?* +
The goblins roll a stealth check vs the passive perception of the players. +
Success: the goblins surprise the players. +
Failure: standard combat encounter.

The adventurers have tracked the goblins through the forest and discovered their hideout. The hideout appears to be an ancient ruin, an old structure infested by the goblins recently. Any players who decide to monitor the hilltop before approaching will spot two goblins patrolling the area. This is a good time to check if the Player Characters are sneaking as they make their approach. 

Determining Surprise Before you begin a combat encounter, you must first determine who, if anyone, is Surprised. If anyone was attempting to be sneaky, prior to the encounter, have them roll a Dexterity (Stealth) Ability Check against a DC set by Passive Perception (10 + the Wisdom Modifier) each creature on the opposing side. A creature actively searching for another creature will roll a Wisdom (Perception) check against the Dexterity (Stealth) roll of the other creature. If neither side attempts to be stealthy, they notice each other at the same time. A surprised creature cannot take an action or move on their first turn. They cannot take a reaction until after their first turn ends.

If any of the adventurers are spotted, the goblins will ready their bows and will not be surprised when the combat begins. After the first round, every time a goblin takes a turn, check to see if they have taken any damage. If they have taken damage, or their buddy was slain, the goblin will retreat to warn its brethren inside the tomb. Until the goblin is either dead, or inside, they will spend their movement retreating and their action firing arrows back at the adventurers. If the goblin patrol survives long enough, you might have him shout a warning to the goblins guarding the entrance of the tomb. If this happens, the Player Characters are in range to see that the guards leave their posts to retreat into the tomb. The guards have gone to alert the others of the danger coming their way.

=== Area 2 - Arrival at the Tomb
Long ago, when the Helvetican empire ruled, a knight by the name of Delius founded the Delian Order and together they devoted their lives to the fight against Whirotepua (chief deity of the goblinoids / orc pantheon). This is their resting place, long forgotten. Today, the goblins who have infested the tomb are preparing to desecrate the site with a human sacrifice. It is their intent to consecrate the tomb in the name of Whirotepua.

Whirotepua is depicted as a powerful and ruthless warrior, with the head of a great black-furred wolf and the body of a muscular goblinoid. He is known as the Mighty One and the High Chieftain, and is worshipped by his followers as a god of war, conquest, and domination. Whirotepua is typically worshipped through blood sacrifices and acts of violence, and his followers often seek to expand their territories and conquer new lands.

People who follow Ohm consider Whirotepua as the devil. The god that opposes civilization, as goblinoids are usually the ones infringing on civilization.

=== Area 3 - Entrance
*DC of 13*

*Goblins are NOT alerted:* +
> Two goblins stand guard before the sundered, stone doors of the tomb. 

*Goblins are alerted:* +
> You see the sundered, stone doors of the tomb. There does not seem to be anything in sight.

If this happens, the Player Characters are in range to see that the guards leave their posts to retreat into the tomb. The guards have gone to alert the others of the danger coming their way.

*Stealth?* +
Roll a Dexterity (Stealth) Ability Check against DC 12. +
Success: they see the goblins and can surprise them. +
Failure: standard combat encounter. +
Goblins will flee inside after 1 round.

*Extra* +
As the Player Characters approach the guards, it would be a good idea to ask them once again if they are attempting to be sneaky. If they are, ask them to roll a Stealth Check against the goblin guards' Passive Perception. It's also possible for the Player Characters to simply use the geometry of the ruins to sneak up on the unwitting guards, easily gaining a Surprise Round when they initiate the combat. On the goblins' first turn of combat, they will both attempt to retreat inside. The presence of the adventurers tells them that the patrol was killed, and they aren't going to stand around awaiting that same fate! After the adventurers have dispatched the goblin guards, they descend into the tomb itself. Remember to describe the tomb using as many senses as seem reasonable to you.

*About the entrance* +
> As you approach the entrance of the Delian Tomb, you can see the weathered stone archway standing before you, its surface covered in patches of moss and tangled vines. The touch of time has left cracks and worn edges on the stone, giving it a rough texture under your fingertips.

include::{rootdir}/statblocks/goblin.adoc[]

=== Area 4 - Offering Room
*DC of 13*

*Show the map once they get to the entrance.*
> It's very dark as you move down the steps and into the tomb, the musty air cools by the step. You can hear faint, rhythmic chatter echoing up from the heart of the structure. Suddenly a high pitch scream.

Once the goblins are dealt with, take a moment to describe the room.

> The brazier at the center of this room gently illuminates the walls. On one side, a detailed carving depicts a company of knights fighting back a torrent of goblins! On the other wall, there is an inscription, it reads: "I swear to fight chaos in all of its forms, to uphold order, by honor of my word"

*In the room:*

* The number of goblins in this room should be equal to 1+ the number of Player Characters.
* Sneak past the patrol? Add 2 extra goblins after round 1.

The goblins have begun their ritual, the distant chatter is the chanting of a goblin shaman. At the bottom of the stairs, a dim light illuminates a large room littered with moldy bedrolls and goblins! Additionally, if the players managed to sneak past the goblin patrol without ever alerting them, they too will join the fight after the first round of combat. If the players have managed to deal with both the patrol and the guards, without allowing them to retreat into the tomb to warn the others — the players have the opportunity to catch these goblins by surprise. If, on the other hand, both sides are aware of the other, be prepared for the players to try some out of the box thinking. They may not want to venture into a den of goblins, they may instead try to flush them out. Be prepared for anything. Let the players experiment. In fact, encourage it!

=== Area 5 - Pressure Plate Trap
*DC of 12*

The next room lies beyond a twisting corridor that fades into darkness beyond the light of of brazier. Halfway down the corridor, just before the turn, there lies a pressure plate trap.

A character who succeeds on a DC 12 Wisdom (Perception) check will notice the trap, the faint light of the brazier just barely catching the raised bit of floor. If a character then succeeds on a DC 10 Dexterity check using thieves' tools, they can disable the trap without triggering it. This can also be attempted with any bladed weapon, but the check is made at disadvantage.

Additionally, if there are any Small sized Player Characters (Halflings, Gnomes) they won't trigger the trap. Any other creature who steps on the pressure plate will trigger the trap, causing a scythe to sweep down from the ceiling. The character who triggered the trap must succeed a on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or suffer 1d8 slashing damage. Once the trap has either been disabled, or triggered it is exhausted and will not be triggered again.

=== Area 6 - Hall of the Oathkeeper
> Dominated by a giant stone statue of a knight, raised up on a dais, standing tall with their sword point down between their feet. A thick haze billows up from a makeshift altar in the center of the room where a goblin adorned with jewelry and warpaint chants rhythmically while they rock back and forth. Behind the goblin, a young girl quietly whimpers, head in her hands, from a small cage near the foot of the statue.

After the fight, when investigating the statue:
> If you are to keep this, you must first give it to me.

*In the room*
* The makeshift altar is covered with bits of charcoal, cork, sulfur, and other spellcasting materials. Amidst these accoutrements there are two potions of healing.
* Near the cage where Bess was being held a few dozen gold pieces and gemstones worth 2d20 + 10 gp.

*Information* +
What was once the sacred chamber consecrated by the Delian Order on behalf of Lord Delius has been desecrated by the goblins. Along with the goblin shaman the leader of this band of miscreants resides here, a bugbear. This is the first time the players have encountered a clever enemy, the bugbear is not driven by fear like his goblin toadies. It will fight tactically, it might even have a potion of healing!

Once the monsters have been slain, and Bess has been helped out from the cage, the players will likely wish to search the room. The makeshift altar is covered with bits of charcoal, cork, sulfur, and other spellcasting materials. Amidst these accoutrements there are two potions of healing. Near the cage where Bess was being held, there is a large nest of blankets where the bugbear slept. The nest is littered with a few dozen gold pieces and gemstones worth 2d20 + 10 gp.

The statue of Delius has an inscription at the base, it reads: If you are to keep this, you must first give it to me. If any character speaks, "I give my word" — or anything in the spirit of that — the secret door leading to the tomb will open!

=== Area 7 - Tomb of the Delian Order
The true resting place of the Delian Order, hidden away behind the Hall of the Oathkeeper. Inside, there are six sarcophagi bearing the resemblances of their knights they hold. As well as a much larger, more elaborately carved sarcophagus at the center, bearing the form of Lord Delius. Each of the sarcophagi have the names of their occupants etched at their feet. There is a journal, mostly rotted away, laying atop Delius' sarcophagus. It is written in Common, and what can be read explains the origin of the Delian Order and their purpose. There are also a number of potions of healing scattered about the tomb, left as offerings to the Order long ago.

If any character attempts to open a sarcophagi, they will disturb the spirits of the Delian Order. Righteous skeletons will emerge from the sarcophagi, eager to expel the desecrators from their tomb. One exception being, in the event that the character who attempts to open a sarcophagi is a Paladin who has sworn the Delian Oath, for they are a member of the Delian Order. The treasures are theirs by holy right! Each sarcophagi holds chainmail, as well as a longsword, and a shield bearing the Coat of Arms of the Delian Order. Delius' sarcophagus hold chainmail, and a shield bearing the Delian crest, as well as the Golbin Slayer Longsword.
