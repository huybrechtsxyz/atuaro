*About*

Pasha Lebedev, aka "The Slacker," is a 9 year old orphan in the orphanage. He has a reputation for trying to avoid doing actual work, and might be seen lounging around, procrastinating, or making excuses to get out of chores or other responsibilities. He might also be seen as lazy and unmotivated.

In terms of clothing and common items, Pasha might wear comfortable, loose-fitting clothes, and carry items that reflect his laid-back attitude, such as a book or game to pass the time.

Pasha's mannerisms might include:

    Slouching or lounging in a relaxed manner
    Procrastinating and making excuses to avoid work
    Making jokes or sarcastic comments to defuse tense situations
    Being disinterested or uninterested in things that require effort.

These mannerisms reflect Pasha's tendency to shirk responsibilities and take things easy, which might make him come across as lazy or unmotivated to others.
