Challenge 1 (200 XP)

Brute. A melee weapon deals one extra die of its damage when the zombie hits with it (included in the attack).

Undead Fortitude. If damage reduces the zombie to 0 hit points, it must make a Constitution saving throw with a DC of 5 + the damage taken, unless the damage is radiant damage or from a critical hit. On a success, the zombie drops to 1 hit point instead.
ACTIONS

Slam. Melee Weapon Attack: +4 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit: 9 (2d6 + 2) bludgeoning damage.

Leadership (Recharges after a Short or Long Rest). For 1 minute, the zombie can utter a special command or warning whenever a nonhostile creature that it can see within 30 feet of it makes an attack roll or a saving throw. The creature can add a d4 to its roll provided it can hear and understand the zombie. A creature can benefit from only one Leadership die at a time. The effect ends if the zombie is incapacitated.
REACTIONS

Parry. The zombie adds 2 to its AC against one melee attack that would hit it. To do so, the zombie must see the attacker and be wielding a melee weapon.
	

A zombie with the Great Undead template applied to it. Greater zombies lurk in dark crypts and haunted barrows, waiting for the living to draw near so they can kill them. Lesser zombies will instinctively obey a greater zombie, but their intellect isn't improved in any way, so they have a tendency to misinterpret orders. Some say that when a zombie kills many living creatures, it will become a greater zombie.
